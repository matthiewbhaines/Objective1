	abstract = {Bitterness and irritation elicited by pharmaceutically active molecules remain problematic for pediatric medications, fortified foods, and dietary supplements. Few effective methods exist for reducing these unpalatable sensations, negatively impacting medication compliance and intake of beneficial phytonutrients. A physicochemical approach to masking these sensations may be the most successful approach for generalizability to a wide range of structurally and functionally unique compounds. Here, solutions of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, were prepared in milk products with varying fat content. Our hypothesis, based on other reports of similar phenomena, was that increasing the fat content would cause ibuprofen to selectively partition into the fat phase, thereby reducing interaction with sensory receptors and decreasing adversive sensations. Quantification of the aqueous concentration of ibuprofen was performed using an isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}) method coupled with an external standard curve. Sensory testing showed a modest but significant decrease (∼20 \%) in irritation ratings between the skim milk (0 \% fat) and the half-and-half (11 \% fat) samples, indicating that increased fat may contribute to a reduced sensory response. Bitterness was not reduced, remaining constant over all fat levels. The {HPLC} results indicate a constant amount of ibuprofen remained in the aqueous phase regardless of fat level, so a simple partitioning hypothesis cannot explain the reduced irritancy ratings. Association of ionized ibuprofen with continuous phase solutes, such as unabsorbed protein, should be explored in future work. © Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC} 2012.},

	abstract = {Both anthropologists and nutritionists have long recognized that the diets of modern-day hunter-gatherers may represent a reference standard for modem human nutrition and a model for defense against certain diseases of affluence. Because the hunter-gatherer way of life is now probably extinct in its purely un-Westernized form, nutritionists and anthropologists must rely on indirect procedures to reconstruct the traditional diet of preagricultural humans. In this analysis, we incorporate the most recent ethnographic compilation of plant-to-animal economic subsistence patterns of hunter- gatherers to estimate likely dietary macronutrient intakes (\% of energy) for environmentally diverse hunter-gatherer populations. Furthermore, we show how differences in the percentage of body fat in prey animals would alter protein intakes in hunter-gatherers and how a maximal protein ceiling influences the selection of other macronutrients. Our analysis showed that whenever and wherever it was ecologically possible, hunter-gatherers consumed high amounts (45-65\% of energy) of animal food. Most (73\%) of the worldwide hunter- gatherer societies derived {\textgreater}50\% (≥56-65\% of energy) of their subsistence from animal foods, whereas only 14\% of these societies derived {\textgreater}50\% (≥56-65\% of energy) of their subsistence from gathered plant foods. This high reliance on animal-based foods coupled with the relatively low carbohydrate content of wild plant foods produces universally characteristic macronutrient consumption ratios in which protein is elevated (19-35\% of energy) at the expense of carbohydrates (22-40\% of energy).},

	abstract = {Whey proteins have very interesting properties including, high solubility in water, strong interactions with polyphenols, aggregation properties and are classified as {GRAS}. Here the application of whey proteins to improve food formulations is evaluated. In particular, the reduction of astringency in wine by whey proteins and peptides was assessed applying an analytical method based on determination of tannins. As shown previously for β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and β-Lg-Caseinomacropeptides fractions, here it was shown that hydrolysates interacted with polymeric polyphenols such as tannins which, led to their complexation and precipitation effectively reducing astringency. In addition, nanoparticles of β-Lg and sweet whey were produced by applying a method developed previously in our group based on heat induced denaturation which could consistently produce nanoparticles of 200–300 nm with high colloidal stability. Here further characterisation of β-Lg nanoparticles showed that addition of ethanol up to 28\% led to nanoparticles destabilisation mainly due to a reduction in β-Lg overall charge. The application of centrifugal force above 863g led to the disruption of colloidal stability and β-Lg sedimentation. However, nanoparticles were stable to freeze drying conditions. Furthermore, it was shown that sweet whey could be used instead of β-Lg to produce nanoparticles of similar characteristics. These β-Lg nanoparticles formed nanocomplexes with resveratrol which, resulted in improved solubility and increased antioxidant activity under pasteurisation conditions. The isomerization from trans to cis and a protective effect of nanoparticles against some chemical changes that result in reduced activity could explain these results. Thus, whey proteins show promise in their application for improved formulations of food/beverages with bioactive ingredients.},

Milk was collected in the spring-summer sea- son, when the dietary units included green forage. At the milk sampling a lactation phase was regarded, that is up to 120 days, from 120 to 200 and over 200. In each milk sample there were determined chemical composition, fat molecule diameter, thermostability and rennet induced milk coagulability. The parameters were analysed taking into consideration a cow breed and a lactation phase. It was found that milk of Whitebacks, Simental and Jersey exhibited a better protein-fat ratio and a high level of fat molecules of big-sized diameters. Milk of these cows and Polish Red withstood a sustained thermal treatment at 140°C and showed significantly shorter coagulation time due to a higher protein content. Therefore, milk from cows of these breeds proves more useful for processing, mainly cheese production. The effect of a lactation phase on milk chemical composition, its thermostability and coagulation time was indicated.},

Until now, it is unclear whether this positive effect of thermal processing occurs with all crop produce. Therefore, analysis of a root vegetable (beets) and of a legume (green beans) was undertaken to address this question. Antioxidant activity of beets processed under typical commercial processing conditions remained constant despite an 8\% loss of vitamin C, a 60\% loss of color, and 30\% loss of dietary folate. There was a slight but significant 5\% increase in phenolic content of processed beets. In contrast, vitamin C and dietary folate content of green beans remained constant, whereas a 32\% reduction in phenolic compounds occurred after typical commercial processing conditions. The antioxidant activity of green beans was reduced by 20\%. These findings along with previous works suggest that the effects of thermal processing vary with the respective produce crop type. It also reinforces the concept that optimal health benefits may be achieved when a wide variety of plant foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains) and preparation methods are incorporated into the diet.},

Therefore, reducing the inflammation can yield a significant health benefit, and one way to achieve this is through diet. We developed a Mediterranean-inspired anti-inflammatory diet and used this diet in a 6-week intervention in a Crohn's disease population. We examined changes in inflammation and also in the gut microbiota. We compared the results of established biomarkers, C-reactive protein and the micronuclei assay, of inflammation with results from a transcriptomic approach. Results: Data showed that being on our diet for 6 weeks was able to reduce the established biomarkers of inflammation. However, using transcriptomics, we observed significant changes in gene expression. Although no single gene stood out, the cumulative effect of small changes in many genes combined to have a beneficial effect. Data also showed that our diet resulted in a trend of normalising the microbiota. Conclusions: This study showed that our Mediterranean-inspired diet appeared to benefit the health of people with Crohn's disease. Our participants showed a trend for reduced markers of inflammation and normalising of the microbiota.

Particle size, charge, protein precipitation capacity, and microscopic image were analyzed. The particle diameter (d43) in the solution containing polyphenols was slightly affected in a solution of Pre-{HWPI} at {pH} 3.2 or 5.2 and clearly increased at {pH} 6.1. The positive ζ-potential observed at {pH} 3.2 decreased slightly. The addition of catechin, grape seed extract and tannic acid, excluding hibiscus extract, induced the increase of negative charge at {pH} 5.2 and 6.1. The presence of polyphenols accelerated the protein precipitation of Pre-{HWPI} at {pH} 3.2 and 5.2 rather than at {pH} 6.1. The different types and concentrations of polyphenols present in Pre-{HWPI}-pectin complexes at {pH} 3.2 and 5.2 showed a small difference in particle size and charge. The addition of polyphenols to the polymer complexes at {pH} 6.1 influenced the increasing particle diameter, and the ζ-potential varied from-12.35 to-19.35mV, depending on the different type and concentration of polyphenol. However, the sedimentation was only clearly observed in the sample containing 0.3 and 0.5\% tannic acid. Furthermore, microscopic images depicted the similar structural appearance of the Pre-{HWPI} and Pre-{HWPI}-pectin complexes in the presence of polyphenols other than tannic acid. In summary, complexation of Pre-{HWPI}-pectin complexes reduces the protein precipitation with polyphenols and allows the use in complex food matrices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) is characterised by gut microbial dysbiosis, in terms of bacterial composition and functionality. {HLA}-B27 (B27) transgenic rat is an established model of gut inflammation often employed to study human {IBD}. The extent to which the microbiota of this model resembles this of human {IBD} has not been reported in the literature. This study aimed to describe comprehensively the microbiota characteristics of B27 rats compared with their healthy {HLA}-B7 (B7) counterparts. Methods: Faecal samples of adult B27 and B7 rats (40-47 weeks) were collected the day prior to sacrifice. Caecal contents, caecal, ileal and colonic tissue and plasma were harvested at sacrifice. Intestinal inflammation was quantified by blinded histological scores. The relative expression ({DELTADELTACt}) of tissue {TNFalpha} gene, plasma concentration of {CCL}-2 and faecal water content were measured. Short-chain fatty acids in faeces and caecal content were measured with {GC} and microbiota composition was characterised using 16s {rRNA} gene sequencing. The concentration and total amount of bacteria in caecal content was measured with real-time {qPCR}. Results: As expected B27 rats had higher inflammatory histology scores in ileum and colon, higher relative gene expression of caecal and colonic {TNF}-a, plasma {CCL}-2 and faecal water content ({DELTAMean}, +2.3, +4.1, +6.6, +5.2, +44.9ng/ml, +15.7\%, all p {\textless} 0.05) compared with the B7 rats. The total caecal amount of butyrate, valerate, iso-butyrate and iso-valerate were significantly lower in B27 compared with B7 ({DELTAMean} mumol,-89.5,-1.2,-0.9,-0.6, all p {\textless} 0.05). Similarly, the faecal concentration of butyrate was significantly lower, while that of acetate and propionate significantly higher ({DELTAMean} mumol/g stool,-9.7, +64.7, +3.4) in B27 than B7 rats. The total number of bacteria in caecal content ({DELTAMean},-0.4 log10 16SrRNA gene copies) was lower in B27 rats and their microbial community was characterised by a lower alpha-diversity (Chao and Shannon) than the B7 group (p {\textless} 0.03). The microbiota structure (beta-diversity) of B27 rats in faeces (p = 0.04) and in caecal content (p = 0.03) was distinct of that of the B7 rats, with the group effect explaining 42\% of the variation. Out of 92 genera, the relative abundance of 42 (45.7\%) was significantly different between the B27 and B7 groups in faeces. This was the case for 32 of the 104 (30.8\%) genera in caecal content. Conclusions: B27 transgenic rats present dysbiotic characteristics similar to human {IBD}, including the lower microbial diversity, the distinct microbiota structure and the reduced abundance of butyrate producing bacteria when compared with healthy status. This suggests that a monogenic cause of intestinal inflammation can drive microbial changes similar to those seen in human {IBD}.},

This research was conducted among 90 patients with {UC} for 12 weeks using an open-labelled randomised controlled trial design. Methods: The participants were randomly assigned into two intervention groups supplemented with {GF} (30 gr/day) and {FO} (10 gr/day) as well as a control group. The participants' data were collected prior to and 12 weeks after the intervention. The one-way analysis of variance was run to compare variables. Results: A total of 75 patients completed the study. After the intervention, hs-{CRP} (P {\textless}.001) and Mayo score (P {\textless}.001) were reduced significantly, but quality of life was increased significantly (P {\textless}.001) in the {GF} and {FO} groups compared with the control. A significant increase was observed in {IL}-10 concentration in the {FO} group, but no significant change was found in serum levels of {IL}-10 in the control group. Moreover, the decrease in Mayo score was greater in patients at more severe stages of the disease (P {\textless}.05). No difference was observed between the intervention groups and control group in {mRNA} expression level of {TLR}4 at the 12th week.

Altered metabolic pathways were examined by quantifying eicosanoid and bile acid profiles in the brain and serum using ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.

The study revealed that the {GC}-O scores of polar odourants were very small or even null, even when these compounds were clearly perceived in the orthonasal evaluation of the synthetic wines. The different parts of the system were thoroughly evaluated and reoptimized, and although partial elution problems affecting polar odourants were detected and corrected, the underestimation of polar odourants persistently remained. A significant improvement was only achieved with a completely redesigned system in which a much larger flow of gas just flows out the sample vapours - instead of bubbling through the liquid - above the strictly non-stirred liquid sample. The {GC}-O scores obtained with this new design were much closer to the orthonasal odour intensity scores of the synthetic models and the underestimation of polar odourants was not observed. A final validation showed that the proposed system is able to provide significantly different {GC}-O signals for solutions containing increasing amounts of polar odourants at perithreshold levels. All this suggests that the transfer of aroma molecules from the sample to the nose during orthonasal olfaction is mass transfer controlled rather than equilibrium driven, which has been experimentally verified using Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Mass Spectrometry ({APCI}-{MS}).},

	abstract = {Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from dietary spice turmeric, possesses diverse pharmacologic effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities. Phase I clinical trials have shown that curcumin is safe even at high doses (12 g/day) in humans but exhibit poor bioavailability. Major reasons contributing to the low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin appear to be due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination. To improve the bioavailability of curcumin, numerous approaches have been undertaken. These approaches involve, first, the use of adjuvant like pipeline that interferes with glucuronidation; second, the use of liposomal curcumin; third, curcumin nanoparticles; fourth, the use of curcumin phospholipid complex; and fifth, the use of structural analogues of curcumin (e.g., {EF}-24). The latter has been reported to have a rapid absorption with a peak plasma half-life. Despite the lower bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy of curcumin against various human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, arthritis, neurological diseases and Crohn's disease, has been documented. Enhanced bioavailability of curcumin in the near future is likely to bring this promising natural product to the forefront of therapeutic agents for treatment of human disease. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {An alternative analysis of forced-choice threshold data sets such as the type generated by {ASTM} method E-679 involves a simple interpolation of chance-corrected 50\% detection. This analysis has several potential advantages. The analysis does not require the ad hoc heuristics for estimating individual thresholds above and below the series. It takes into account the possibility of guessing correctly, which is not considered in the {ASTM} calculations and produces a downward bias to the estimates. It does not discount correct responses early in the series which may be legitimate detections, but which are discounted by the {ASTM} method if followed by any incorrect response. Comparisons of the two methods in a large consumer study of odor detection threshold study data set gave comparable values. The interpolation can also be done to determine other levels of detection (e.g. 10, 25\%). These values other than 50\% can be potentially useful in setting regulatory standards for water or air pollution limits or to food manufacturers who wish to avoid detection of taints by more sensitive individuals. © 2010, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Twenty-two adult {CD} patients who achieved clinical remission either medically (n = 17) or surgically (n = 5) and consumed an {SVD} during hospitalization were advised to continue with an {SVD} and avoid known high-risk foods for inflammatory bowel disease. The primary endpoint was clinical relapse defined as the appearance of active symptoms of {CD}. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative proportion of patients who had a relapse. A 2-year analysis of relapse rates of patients who followed an {SVD} and those who did not (an omnivorous diet group) was undertaken. {RESULTS}: {SVD} was continued by 16 patients (compliance 73\%). Remission was maintained in 15 of 16 patients (94\%) in the {SVD} group vs two of six (33\%) in the omnivorous group. Remission rate with {SVD} was 100\% at 1 year and 92\% at 2 years. {SVD} showed significant prevention in the time to relapse compared to that in the omnivorous group (P = 0.0003, log rank test). The concentration of C-reactive protein was normal at the final visit in more than half of the patients in remission who were taking an {SVD}, who maintained remission during the study (9/15; 60\%), who terminated follow-up (8/12; 67\%), and who completed 2 years follow-up (7/10; 70\%). There was no untoward effect of {SVD}. {CONCLUSION}: {SVD} was highly effective in preventing relapse in {CD}. © 2010 Baishideng.},

Therefore, there is the need to evaluate changes in sensory qualities of coffee beverages prepared from stored coffee beans. For preparation of the coffee beverages, the paper filter method was used. In the quantitative descriptive analysis ({QDA}) 10 trained assessors evaluated the intensity of 30 coffee attributes after roasting at the 9th and 18th month of storage, respectively. The sensory evaluation results showed reduction in the sensory qualities of coffee beverages after 9 months storage of roasted coffee beans. The positive associated odor and flavor attributes decreased in their intensity, whereas the negative associated odor and flavor attributes increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05). After 18 months of storage, the rancid odor and flavor which indicate oxidation processes were even considerably perceivable. Consequently, we can assume that changes in sensory quality characteristics of roasted and vacuum-packed coffee beans during storage are possible.},

However, their bitterness, astringency and characteristic flavour could limit their incorporation in foods and beverages. Four alternatives to reduce the bitterness, astringency, and characteristic flavour of antioxidant extracts of two Uruguayan native plants (Achyrocline satureioides and Baccharis trimera) were studied: sucrose, sucralose, polydextrose, and milk. All the evaluated alternatives highly significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) reduced the bitterness, astringency and characteristic flavour of the extracts. However, their effectiveness depended on the type and concentration of the antioxidant extract being considered.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown positive effects of regular coffee-drinking on various aspects of health, such as psychoactive responses (alertness, mood change), neurological (infant hyperactivity, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) and metabolic disorders (diabetes, gallstones, liver cirrhosis), and gonad and liver function. Despite this, most reviews do not mention coffee as fulfilling the criteria for a functional food. Unlike other functional foods that act on a defined population with a special effect, the wide use of coffee-drinking impacts a broad demographic (from children to the elderly), with a wide spectrum of health benefits.

This narrative review provides an overview of the effect of coffee brew; its by-products; and its components on the gastrointestinal mucosa (mainly involved in permeability, secretion, and proliferation), the neural and non-neural components of the gut wall responsible for its motor function, and the brain–gut axis. Despite in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies having shown that coffee may exert multiple effects on the digestive tract, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects on the mucosa, and pro-motility effects on the external muscle layers, much is still surprisingly unknown. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of action of certain health-promoting properties of coffee on the gastrointestinal tract and to transfer this knowledge to the industry to develop functional foods to improve the gastrointestinal and brain–gut axis health.},

In an effort to demystify the causes of the uncanny valley, this paper proposes several perceptual, cognitive, and social mechanisms that have already helped address riddles like empathy, mate selection, threat avoidance, cognitive dissonance, and psychological defenses. In the four studies described herein, a computer generated human character's facial proportions, skin texture, and level of detail were varied to examine their effect on perceived eeriness, human likeness, and attractiveness. In Study I, texture photorealism and polygon count increased human likeness. In Study {II}, texture photorealism heightened the accuracy of human judgments of ideal facial proportions. In Study {III}, atypical facial proportions were shown to be more disturbing on photorealistic faces than on other faces. In Study {IV}, a mismatch in the size and texture of the eyes and face was especially prone to make a character eerie. These results contest the depiction of the uncanny valley as a simple relation between comfort level and human likeness.

Moreover saliva contains enzymes and molecules that can interact with food. To date, little research has been devoted to the intra- and inter-individual variabilities of these components and their inter-relationships. The first aim of this work was to study intra- and inter-individual variabilities over time in the composition of molecules likely to interact with food in the mouth, with particular focus on molecules that might interact with fat. The second aim was to try to relate this composition to a liking for fat and its perception. Stimulated and unstimulated saliva from 13 subjects was collected in the morning and afternoon on three occasions at 4-month intervals. Saliva characteristics such as flow, protein concentration, lipolysis, proteolysis, amylolysis, lipocalin concentration, lysozyme activity, total antioxidant status and uric acid concentrations were measured, as well as the liking for and perceived fattiness of a fat solution. The results showed that for most of the measured characteristics, intra-subject variability in saliva composition was smaller than inter-subject variability, with remarkable stability over time (8 months) in terms of flow, lypolysis, proteolysis and total antioxidant status. Relationships were found between some of these characteristics (lipolysis, lipocalin and flow) and fat-liking or perception, showing that the composition of saliva may play an important role in fat perception and liking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We tested relationships between {TAS}2R38 genotype, taste phenotype, and fungiform papillae ({FP}) number in 139 females and 59 males (age range 21-60 years), primarily of European ancestry. {DNA} was analyzed for 3 polymorphic sites, identifying common (alanine-valine-isoleucine [{AVI}/{AVI}], heterozygotes, proline-alanine-valine [{PAV}/{PAV}]) and rare (proline-valine-isoleucine, alanine-alanine-valine, {AAI}) forms. Individuals with {PROP} threshold {\textgreater}0.15 {mM} were almost exclusively {AVI}/{AVI}; those with threshold {\textless}0.1 {mM} could have any genotype. {PAV}/{PAVs} were more difficult to identify with {PROP} taste measures, although perceived bitterness of moderate {PROP} concentrations (0.32, 1 {mM}) had better correspondence with genotype than did threshold. For {AVI}/{AVIs}, increases in bitterness from 1 to 3.2 {mM} {PROP} nearly paralleled those of {TAS}2R38 heterozygotes and {PAV}/{PAVs}. Some bitterness gains were related to {FP} number sampled from a standard area on the tongue tip, yet the {PROP} bitterness-{FP} relationship differed across genotype. Among homozygotes, {FP} was a significant determinant of {PROP} bitterness; heterozygotes showed a flat relationship. Those tasting concentrated {PROP} as more bitter also tasted concentrated sucrose, citric acid, sodium chloride, and quinine as more intense, even after statistically controlling for {TAS}2R38 genotype, {FP}, and intensity of tones (nonoral standard). To summarize, although {PROP} threshold generally exhibited single-gene complete dominance, {PROP} bitterness may involve additional bitter receptors as evidenced by misclassification of some nontaster homozygotes and the bitterness functions for concentrated {PROP}. Variability in receptor expression may explain attenuated bitterness-{FP} relationships. {PROP} bitterness does associate with heightened taste sensations (i.e., supertasting), but this is not due to {TAS}2R38 polymorphisms.

Post-fermentation addition of casein and especially {PVPP} reduced total and polymeric phenols, and lightened the color of the red wine. {PVPP} also reduced the brown color in the red wine.

In the past, bitterness reduction was focused on pharmaceuticals and drugs; however, more recently, the most intense research is performed on the reduction of bitter or astringent taste in functional food or beverage applications. These foods and beverages possess inherent off-tastes due to fortification with healthy but poor-tasting actives. During the last 10 years, tremendous progress in the elucidation of bitter taste reception and transduction on the cellular level was made and many new molecules and compounds to reduce bitter off-tastes were reported. The following review will be focused on the advances, in the area of bitter-masking molecules, during the last 10 years. It will not cover other debittering strategies such as process optimization or biotransformations to reduce the amount of bitter ingredients, encapsulation, and other physical formulation technologies. The review will close with a short comparative study of various bitter maskers and some suggestions for flavor development of poor-tasting ingredients.},

	abstract = {Bitter taste stimuli are detected by a diverse family of G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) expressed in gustatory cells. Each bitter taste receptor ({TAS}2R) responds to an array of compounds, many of which are toxic and can be found in nature. For example, human {TAS}2R16 ({hTAS}2R16) responds to β-glucosides such as salicin, and {hTAS}2R38 responds to thiourea-containing molecules such as glucosinolates and phenylthiocarbamide ({PTC}). While many substances are known to activate {TAS}2Rs, only one inhibitor that specifically blocks bitter receptor activation has been described. Here, we describe a new inhibitor of bitter taste receptors, p-(dipropylsulfamoyl)benzoic acid (probenecid), that acts on a subset of {TAS}2Rs and inhibits through a novel, allosteric mechanism of action. Probenecid is an {FDA}-approved inhibitor of the Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 ({MRP}1) transporter and is clinically used to treat gout in humans. Probenecid is also commonly used to enhance cellular signals in {GPCR} calcium mobilization assays. We show that probenecid specifically inhibits the cellular response mediated by the bitter taste receptor {hTAS}2R16 and provide molecular and pharmacological evidence for direct interaction with this {GPCR} using a non-competitive (allosteric) mechanism. Through a comprehensive analysis of {hTAS}2R16 point mutants, we define amino acid residues involved in the probenecid interaction that result in decreased sensitivity to probenecid while maintaining normal responses to salicin. Probenecid inhibits {hTAS}2R16, {hTAS}2R38, and {hTAS}2R43, but does not inhibit the bitter receptor {hTAS}2R31 or non-{TAS}2R {GPCRs}. Additionally, structurally unrelated {MRP}1 inhibitors, such as indomethacin, fail to inhibit {hTAS}2R16 function. Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of probenecid in cellular experiments translates to inhibition of bitter taste perception of salicin in humans. This work identifies probenecid as a pharmacological tool for understanding the cell biology of bitter taste and as a lead for the development of broad specificity bitter blockers to improve nutrition and medical compliance. © 2011 Greene et al.},

	abstract = {Background. The roasting stage constitutes a key component in the manufacturing process of natural coffee because temperature elicits changes in bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and that Maillard-reaction compounds appear, thus affecting the product's sensory and antioxidant properties. Actual contents of these compounds may depend on which region the coffee is cultivated as well as the extent to which the beans are roasted. Objectives. To determine polyphenols content and antioxidant activity in the 'Arabica' coffee type coming from various world regions of its cultivation and which have undergone industrial roasting. Also to establish which coffee, taking into account the degree of roasting (ie. light, medium and strong), is nutritionally the most beneficial. Materials and Methods. The study material was natural coffee beans (100\% Arabica) roasted to various degrees, as aforementioned, that had been cultivated in Brazil, Ethiopia, Columbia and India. Polyphenols were measured in the coffee beans by spectrophotometric means based on the Folin-Ciocalteu reaction, whereas antioxidant activity was measured colourimetrically using {ABTS} + cat-ionic radicals. Results. Polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were found to depend both on the coffee's origin and degree of roasting. Longer roasting times resulted in greater polyphenol degradation. The highest polyphenol concentrations were found in lightly roasted coffee, ranging 39.27 to 43.0 mg/g, whereas levels in medium and strongly roasted coffee respectively ranged 34.06 to 38.43 mg/g and 29.21 to 36.89 mg/g. Antioxidant activity however significantly rose with the degree of roasting, where strongly roasted coffee had higher such activity than lightly roasted coffee. This can be explained by the formation of Maillard-reaction compounds during roasting, leading then to the formation of antioxidant melanoidin compounds which, to a large extent, compensate for the decrease in polyphenols during roasting. Conclusions. Polyphenols levels and antioxidant activities in the studied Arabica coffee beans that had undergone roasting depended on the cultivation region of the world. Longer roasting caused a significant decline in polyphenols compound levels (from 7.3\% to 32.1\%) in the coffee beans. Antioxidant activities of coffee increased with roasting, despite reduced levels of natural antioxidants. From a nutritional standpoint, the most favoured coffees are those lightly or medium roasted.},

This masking depends on both the protein and the flavonoid used. Components in green and black tea, which show the highest masking in combination with β-casein, are epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid.

	abstract = {Sensory profiles of 13 coffee samples from the Huila Region, Colombia were evaluated using two different sensory panels: a highly trained descriptive sensory panel and a group of Q-certified coffee cuppers. The trained panel consisted of six descriptive panelists who developed a lexicon to evaluate and then test the coffee samples. Four "cuppers" scored the same samples based on the Specialty Coffee Association of America "cupping protocol." In addition, cuppers generated tasting notes to characterize the different coffee samples. Data indicated little overlap between the two methods and a low relationship between the two different sets of terms. Moreover, tasting notes by cuppers indicate lack of agreement on the terms used to describe samples, with only four terms used by more than two assessors to describe a single coffee product out of a total of 59 terms used by the cuppers. The results indicate that the cupping method and sensory descriptive methods provide different information that cannot be used as an alternative to each other when describing coffee products. Instead, the results suggest that the two types of data may be used synergistically to evaluate the quality and the sensory properties to better characterize coffee samples. Practical Applications: This research shows that "expert" coffee cupper data and trained sensory panel data cannot be used interchangeably. Thus, for research purposes sensory panel information is necessary for tracking changes in sensory properties. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The goal of this study was to investigate the binding of bitterants (quinine and caffeine) by whey protein isolate ({WPI}) and the effect on perceived bitterness. Caffeine interacted minimally with {WPI}, while the proportion of unbound quinine decreased exponentially with protein concentration. Molecular modeling was used to show the energy of the quinine-Β-lactoglubulin interaction was an order of magnitude greater than the caffeine-Β-lactoglobulin interaction. Untrained assessors were used to assess the bitterness of caffeine (1.8, 5.7, and 18 {mM}) and quinine (0.056, 0.10, and 0.18 {mM}) solutions with 0\% or 1\% {WPI}. There was no significant effect of protein on the bitterness of caffeine solutions, but {WPI} decreased the bitterness of quinine relative to the same concentration in water. This is generally consistent with our hypothesis that higher binding results in lower bitterness; however the magnitude of reduction was not large and the bitterness of the protein-quinine solutions was greater than would be expected for the unbound quinine present.},

	abstract = {Humanlike but not perfectly human agents frequently evoke feelings of eeriness, a phenomenon termed the Uncanny Valley ({UV}). The Categorical Perception Hypothesis proposes that effects associated with the {UV} are due to uncertainty as to whether to categorize agents falling into the valley as “human” or “nonhuman”. However, since {UV} studies have traditionally looked at agents of varying human-likeness, it remains unclear whether {UV}-related effects are due to categorical uncertainty in general or are specifically evoked by categorizations that require decisions regarding an agent's human-likeness. Here, we used mouse tracking to determine whether agent spectra with (i.e., robot-human) and without (i.e., robot-animal and robot-stuffed animal) a human endpoint cause phenomena related to categorical perception to comparable extents. Specifically, we compared human and nonhuman agent spectra with respect to existence and location of a category boundary (H1-1 and H2-1), as well as the magnitude of cognitive conflict around the boundary (H1-2 and H2-2). The results show that human and nonhuman spectra exhibit category boundaries (H1-1) at which cognitive conflict is higher than for less ambiguous parts of the spectra (H1-2). However, in human agent spectra cognitive conflict maxima were more pronounced than for nonhuman agent spectra (H2-1) and category boundaries were shifted towards the human endpoint of the spectrum (H2-2). Overall, these results suggest a quantitatively, though not qualitatively, different categorization process for spectra containing human endpoints. Possible reasons and the impact for virtual and robotic agent design are discussed.},

However, the insertion of a 15-min delay in stimulation resulted in a reduction in the intensity of the sensations produced by further stimulation, i.e., desensitization occurred. Desensitization was statistically significant even after exposure to as few as 5 stimuli prior to the delay.

Bitter compounds and acids can either enhance or suppress each other depending on the concentrations, the food stimuli and the experimental methods involved.

	abstract = {Spontaneous activity of the human brain has been well documented, but little is known about the functional role of this ubiquitous neural phenomenon. It has previously been hypothesized that spontaneous brain activity underlies unprompted (internally generated) behaviour. We tested whether spontaneous brain activity might underlie internally-generated vision by studying the cortical visual system of five blind/visually-impaired individuals who experience vivid visual hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Neural populations in the visual system of these individuals are deprived of external input, which may lead to their hyper-sensitization to spontaneous activity fluctuations. To test whether these spontaneous fluctuations can subserve visual hallucinations, the functional {MRI} brain activity of participants with Charles Bonnet syndrome obtained while they reported their hallucinations (spontaneous internally-generated vision) was compared to the: (i) brain activity evoked by veridical vision (externally-triggered vision) in sighted controls who were presented with a visual simulation of the hallucinatory streams; and (ii) brain activity of non-hallucinating blind controls during visual imagery (cued internally-generated vision). All conditions showed activity spanning large portions of the visual system. However, only the hallucination condition in the Charles Bonnet syndrome participants demonstrated unique temporal dynamics, characterized by a slow build-up of neural activity prior to the reported onset of hallucinations. This build-up was most pronounced in early visual cortex and then decayed along the visual hierarchy. These results suggest that, in the absence of external visual input, a build-up of spontaneous fluctuations in early visual cortex may activate the visual hierarchy, thereby triggering the experience of vision.},

	abstract = {The use of potassium caseinate for wine fining can cause allergic reactions and must be included on wine bottle labels. The focus of this research was to determine if non-allergenic pea protein or polyvinylpolypyrrolidone ({PVPP}) are possible alternatives for wine fining. Trials were performed to compare the effects of these potential fining agents on phenolic compounds, browning potential, turbidity and sensory attributes. The results indicate that flavonoid and non-flavonoid phenols decreased (p{\textless}0.05) in the wines treated with potassium caseinate, pea protein, and {PVPP}. All fining agents decreased (p{\textless}0.05) wine colour. Potassium caseinate was the most effective fining agent for reducing browning potential. Pea protein and potassium caseinate resulted in increased clarity of the final wines. No sensorial differences (p{\textless}0.05) were detected among the wines prepared with the different fining agents. This study provides information that could be used to select an appropriate alternative to potassium caseinate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

It has been argued that such a reduction may not be limited to food liking but extends to food wanting as well. Animal research suggests that sensory-specific satiety reflects a reduction in both food liking and food wanting and in the present study it was investigated whether this also holds true for humans. Participants had to consume a certain amount of chocolate milk and afterwards approximately half of the participants played a game to obtain more chocolate milk, whereas the other half played a game to obtain crisps. Participants showed a decline in subjective liking of taste and smell of the chocolate milk in comparison to crisps. Furthermore, they showed less motivation (i.e. wanting) to obtain more chocolate milk. It is concluded that sensory-specific satiety in humans reflects a decrease in both food liking and food wanting. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this work, the interactions between epigallocatechin-gallate ({EGCG}), one of the main tea catechins, and caseins at an oil water interface were studied. The association of {EGCG} with sodium caseinate was quantified by measuring the amount of {EGCG} adsorbed on the emulsion droplets. In addition, the viscoelastic properties of the protein and {EGCG}-protein layers formed at the interface were studied using drop tensiometry. Different concentrations of {EGCG} were added to a model emulsion to obtain final concentrations of 10\% soybean oil, 0.5\% sodium caseinate and 0-9mg/{mL} {EGCG}. At concentrations{\textless}2mg/{mL} {EGCG}, more than 90\% was adsorbed at the interface. At higher concentrations, below 5mg/{mL}, about 70\% of {EGCG} was adsorbed. The surface load reached about 1mg/m$^{\textrm{2}}$ at 9mg/{mL} of {EGCG}. The dissociation constant for the complex formed, was estimated using schatchard plot, and was 3.7×10$^{\textrm{-5}}$M for less than 20mol bound {EGCG}/protein. The interactions of {EGCG} with sodium caseinate did not affect the interfacial tension but increased the dilational modulus of the {EGCG}-protein layer at the interface. This study demonstrated that sodium caseinate emulsions could be employed as carriers for {EGCG}, and that the complexes formed at the interface are affecting the physico-chemical properties of the emulsions. The results are of significance in the development of dairy based beverages containing tea polyphenols.},

Higher caffeine perception was also associated with increased risk of being a heavy ({\textgreater}4 cups/day) coffee drinker ({OR} 1.207 [1.126, 1.294]). Opposite pattern of associations was observed for tea possibly due to the inverse relationship between both beverages. Alcohol intake was only negatively associated with {PROP} perception (−0.141 [−1.88, −0.94] times/month per {SD} increase in {PROP} bitterness).

A key molecule, α-gustducin, a primarily taste-specific G protein α-subunit, was discovered in 1992 and was later found to be involved in both bitter and sweet taste transduction. A proposed mechanism for α-gustducin involves coupling specific cell-surface receptors with a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase which would open a cyclic nucleotide-suppressible cation channel leading to influx of calcium, and ultimately leading to release of neurotransmitter. Although "knock-out" animals deficient in the α-gustducin gene clearly demonstrate that gustducin is an essential molecule for tasting certain bitter and sweet compounds, the precise role of α-gustducin in bitter and sweet taste is presently unclear. Indeed, there are several other signaling mechanisms in sweet and bitter taste, apparently unrelated to α-gustducin, that increase cyclic {AMP} or inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate. Thus, proposed models for α-gustducin and those found by other laboratories may be parallel and interdependent.},

	abstract = {Human bitter taste is mediated by the {hTAS}2R family of G protein-coupled receptors [1-4]. The discovery of the {hTAS}2Rs enables the potential to develop specific bitter receptor antagonists that could be beneficial as chemical probes to examine the role of bitter receptor function in gustatory and nongustatory tissues. In addition, they could have widespread utility in food and beverages fortified with vitamins, antioxidants, and other nutraceuticals, because many of these have unwanted bitter aftertastes. We employed a high-throughput screening approach to discover a novel bitter receptor antagonist ({GIV}3727) that inhibits activation of {hTAS}2R31 (formerly {hTAS}2R44) by saccharin and acesulfame K, two common artificial sweeteners. Pharmacological analyses revealed that {GIV}3727 likely acts as an orthosteric, insurmountable antagonist of {hTAS}2R31. Surprisingly, we also found that this compound could inhibit five additional {hTAS}2Rs, including the closely related receptor {hTAS}2R43. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that two residues in helix 7 are important for antagonist activity in {hTAS}2R31 and {hTAS}2R43. In human sensory trials, {GIV}3727 significantly reduced the bitterness associated with the two sulfonamide sweeteners, indicating that {hTAS}2R antagonists are active in vivo. Our results demonstrate that small molecule bitter receptor antagonists can effectively reduce the bitter taste qualities of foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that both abilities were impaired in these patients, with some weak residual ability for attractiveness judgments found only in those patients with unilateral right occipitotemporal or bilateral anterior temporal lesions. Importantly, deficits in attractiveness perception correlated with the severity of the face recognition deficit. Second, we performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in healthy subjects that included an implicit and explicit processing of facial attractiveness. We found increased neural activity when explicitly judging facial attractiveness within a number of cortical regions including the fusiform face area, but not the superior temporal sulcus, indicating a potential contribution of the fusiform face area to this judgment. Thus, converging neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence points to a critical role of the inferior occipitotemporal cortex in the processing of facial attractiveness. © 2008 {IBRO}.},

	abstract = {Thiols are among the compounds that have the greatest impact on the flavor of coffee. Due to their extremely low odor thresholds, they have a significant sensory impact even at very low concentrations. Thiols are formed during coffee roasting and are described as the key odorants responsible for the typical “coffee” and “roasty” odor notes, greatly influencing the sensory characteristics of coffee. They are particularly reactive and prone to oxidation; their rapid depletion after preparation of a coffee brew and during storage of roasted coffee has been associated with sensory quality decrease and coffee going stale. For these reasons, their determination and insight into their formation and degradation mechanisms could help us to preserve the sensory quality of coffee and to modulate its sensory features. Coffee aroma has been widely studied in recent decades, and it has become evident that the role of certain volatile thiols is paramount. Nevertheless, a limited number of studies have specifically addressed this class of compounds, and several aspects have not yet been satisfactorily elucidated. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state on knowledge about coffee thiols, focusing on their occurrence, determination, sensory impact, formation and evolution in roasted and brewed coffee.},

Subjects (n = 33) assessed the influence of sodium gluconate (100 {mM}), zinc lactate (5 {mM}), sucrose (125 {mM} and 250 {mM}), milk (0\%, 2\% and 4\% milk fat), and aromas (coffee, chocolate, mocha) on the bitterness of caffeine (1.5, 3 and 4.5 {mM}). The oral peripheral strategies proved most effective at suppressing the bitterness of caffeine: zinc lactate (-71\%, p {\textless} 0.05), non-fat milk (-49\%, p {\textless} 0.05), and sodium gluconate (-31\%). Central cognitive strategies were partially effective: 250 {mM} sucrose (-47\%, p {\textless} 0.05) and mocha aroma (-10\%) decreased bitterness, while chocolate (+32\%) and coffee (+17\%) aromas increased perceived bitterness. Overall, zinc lactate was the most effective bitterness inhibitor, however the utility of zinc in foods is negated by its ability to inhibit sweetness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We examined whether individual differences in sucrose and fat preferences and perception are related to age, genotype and lifestyle.Subjects:Children 5–10 years-old (n=84) and their mothers (n=67) chose the concentration of sucrose and fat most preferred in pudding and sucrose most preferred in water using identical, two-alternative, forced-choice procedures, and ranked pudding samples for intensity of sweetness and creaminess. Subjects were also weighed and measured for height, as well as genotyped for a sweet-receptor gene ({TAS}1R3).Results:Children preferred higher concentrations of sucrose in water (P=0.03) and in pudding (P=0.05) and lower concentrations of fat in pudding (P{\textless}0.01) than did mothers. Children and mothers were equally able to rank the intensity of different concentrations of fat (P=0.12) but not sucrose in pudding (P=0.01). Obese and lean children and mothers did not differ in preferences, but obese mothers were less able to correctly rank the concentration of fat in pudding than were lean mothers (P=0.03). Mothers who smoked preferred a higher concentration of sucrose than did those who never smoked (P{\textless}0.01). Individual differences in sweet preference were associated with genetic variation within the {TAS}1R3 gene in mothers but not children (P=0.04).Conclusion:Irrespective of genotype, children prefer higher concentrations of sugar but lower concentrations of fat in puddings than do their mothers. Thus, reduced-fat foods may be better accepted by children than adults. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

The extraction kinetics of 20 key coffee odorants from a coffee bed were measured using quantitative in-cup aroma analysis. The kinetics differed depending on the coffee odorants' properties. The extraction speed could be correlated with the odorants' polarity. Higher polar components, such as 2,3-butanedione, were released much faster from the coffee bed as compared to lower polar ones such as β-damascenone. In contrast, the odorants' volatility did not seem to play a major role. Due to the different kinetics of extraction of the coffee odorants, the in-cup aroma balance changed continuously as more water passed through the coffee bed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A group of 35 young (20-30 years), and 31 elderly (67-86 years) judged the perceived intensity and pleasantness of different flavour concentrations in hot tomato soup, hot bouillon, orange lemonade and chocolate custard. The results showed that on average elderly subjects had higher optimal preferred concentrations than young subjects. The slopes of the psychophysical functions were lower for elderly subjects compared to the young subjects. Optimal preferred intensities were equal for tomato-soup and bouillon, but higher for the elderly in the cases of orange lemonade and chocolate custard.

A critical review and meta-analyses indicate that all three are attractive in both male and female faces and across cultures. Theorists have proposed that face preferences may be adaptations for mate choice because attractive traits signal important aspects of mate quality, such as health. Others have argued that they may simply be by-products of the way brains process information.

Whereas the first set of techniques showed small differences among the mean ratings of the samples, a wide range of consumer preferences was observed in the preference maps. As the level of garlic flavor increased, liking increased, especially among women. Fat content did not drive liking as strongly as garlic flavor.

We found that using the {ABTS}+ assays, the antioxidant activity of all polyphenols was lowered by 11-27\% in the presence of caseins. Using cyclic voltammetry, the overall current measured at the electrode was decreased by the presence of the protein, from 21\% to 61\%. The peak potentials were also shifted to higher values varying from 13 to 41 {mV}. However, using lipid peroxidation method, we noticed of the antioxidant activity of all the polyphenols changed (from 6\% up to 75\%) after the addition of alpha-casein. The results show using this method the larger gallate esters containing polyphenols epicatechingallate ({ECG}) and (epigallocatechingallate ({EGCG}) were less affected by the presence of casein than smaller polyphenols catechins (C), epicatechin ({EC}) and epicgallocatechine ({EGC}). Alpha-casein caused a small effect on the chain breaking antioxidant capacity of theaflavins as well. Therefore, casein has different effects on the overall antioxidant capacities of tea compounds depending on the methods used. We aim to understand those results with the types of protein-polyphenol interactions that take place in various settings and their effects on the antioxidant capacities of those compounds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Past studies present contradictory results regarding the effect of milk on the antioxidant capacities of teas, possibly because of the different methods used. Here, we re-address the question by using three complementary assays, {ABTS}+ free radical scavenging, voltammetry, and lipid peroxidation inhibition, to estimate how milk affects the antioxidant capacities of green, Darjeeling, and English breakfast teas. We observed that milk decreased the antioxidant capacities of Darjeeling (-8.3\%), green (-6.0\%), and English breakfast (-19.6\%) teas, estimated with the {ABTS}+ method. These inhibitions were four times larger using voltammetry. In contrast, milk enhanced the chain-breaking antioxidant capacity of teas in the lipid peroxidation method by 19\%, 12\%, and 10\%, for green, English breakfast, and Darjeeling teas, respectively. Therefore, milk can have dual effects on the tea antioxidant capacity, an inhibitory effect for reactions occurring in solution or at a solid-liquid interface and an enhancing effect for those in oil-in-water emulsion. The mechanisms responsible for these different milk-tea interactions are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: Using self-refilling soup bowls, this study examined whether visual cues related to portion size can influence intake volume without altering either estimated intake or satiation. Research Methods and Procedures: Fifty-four participants ({BMI}, 17.3 to 36.0 kg/m2; 18 to 46 years of age) were recruited to participate in a study involving soup. The experiment was a between-subject design with two visibility levels: 1) an accurate visual cue of a food portion (normal bowl) vs. 2) a biased visual cue (self-refilling bowl). The soup apparatus was housed in a modified restaurant-style table in which two of four bowls slowly and imperceptibly refilled as their contents were consumed. Outcomes included intake volume, intake estimation, consumption monitoring, and satiety. Results: Participants who were unknowingly eating from self-refilling bowls ate more soup [14.7 ± 8.4 vs. 8.5 ± 6.1 oz;F(1,52) = 8.99; p {\textless} 0.01] than those eating from normal soup bowls. However, despite consuming 73\% more, they did not believe they had consumed more, nor did they perceive themselves as more sated than those eating from normal bowls. This was unaffected by {BMI}. Discussion: These findings are consistent with the notion that the amount of food on a plate or bowl increases intake because it influences consumption norms and expectations and it lessens one's reliance on self-monitoring. It seems that people use their eyes to count calories and not their stomachs. The importance of having salient, accurate visual cues can play an important role in the prevention of unintentional overeating. Copyright © 2005 {NAASO}.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces biophysics of taste. Taste transduction is initiated when a sapid stimulus interacts with a specific receptor entity of a taste receptor cell. Taste receptor cells are neuroepithehal cells that are usually clustered into multicellular arrays called taste buds. The taste bud — being an epithehal structure — is functionally divisible into two parts: the apical region and the basal region. The apical region faces the oral cavity and is the site of interaction of most stimuli with taste receptor cells. The apical region and the lower basal region are separated by tight junctions that — as they do in all epitheha — effectively limit the diffusion of many compounds from the mucosal to the serosal space. This barrier insulates the intracellular space around the basal region from most substances that enter the oral cavity. This diffusion barrier has important implications for taste transduction because it limits the area of interaction of stimuli with the receptor cell membrane and acts as a selective filter for many ions, thereby, directly affecting the magnitude of some tastes, as is the case for salty taste transduction.},

	abstract = {In this work, discrimination tests, descriptive analysis, consumer tests, and total dissolved solids ({TDS}) were used to evaluate the effects of brew basket geometry on the sensory quality and consumer acceptance of drip brewed coffee. Two basic geometries, semi-conical and flat-bottom, were evaluated in conjunction with coffee roast and particle size. Initial discrimination tests showed that small differences in median particle size were not discernable, but that coffees brewed using either semi-conical or flat-bottom filter baskets were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05, N = 45). Additionally, coffee brewed in the semi-conical basket had significantly higher \%{TDS}, and we estimated a sensory difference threshold of 0.24 \%{TDS}. A subsequent descriptive analysis ({DA}) showed significant differences by roast for 11 attributes and by grind for six attributes. Although brewing geometry, as a single factor, was only significantly different for three independent attributes (smoke aroma, sweetness, and tobacco flavor), roast × geometry interactions were significant for six attributes (berry flavor, bitterness, burnt wood/ash, citrus flavor, earthy flavor, and sourness) and the grind × geometry interaction was significant for two attributes (bitterness and floral aroma). Attributes showing significant interactions with brewing geometry were also key drivers of consumer liking/disliking. Overall consumer liking (9-point hedonic scale) was analyzed by cluster analysis (N = 85), which revealed four distinct preference clusters. For each cluster, a particular basket geometry and/or roast level showed lesser acceptance. Overall, the results strongly corroborate the hypothesis that basket geometry affects the sensory quality of drip brewed coffee. Practical Application: Most Americans consume drip brewed coffee. Improving our understanding of the effects of basket geometry, roast level, and grind size on the total dissolved solids, sensory properties, and acceptability of drip brewed coffee gives producers and consumers alike an opportunity to optimize the sensory quality of their coffee.},

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of various brewing methods on the total phenolic content ({TPC}) in the infusion. Research material comprised commercially available coffees: Instant Arabica and Robusta, freshly ground Arabica and Robusta (immediately prior to the analysis), ground Arabica and Robusta, decaffeinated Arabica, and green Arabica and Robusta. The following preparation methods were used: Pouring hot water over coffee grounds or instant coffee, preparing coffee in a percolator and using a coffee machine. Additional variables which were employed were water temperature (90 or 100 °C) and its type (filtered or unfiltered). In order to determine the impact of examined factors, 225 infusion were prepared. Total phenolic content was determined by the spectrophotometric method using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the obtained results were expressed in mg gallic acid ({GAE}) per 100 g of brewed coffee. The highest value was obtained for 100\% Arabica ground coffee prepared in a coffee percolator using unfiltered water at a temperature of 100 °C: 657.3 ± 23 mg {GAE}/100 g of infusion. High values were also observed for infusions prepared in a coffee machine, where the highest {TPC} value was 363.8 ± 28 mg {GAE}/100 g for ground Arabica. In turn, the lowest {TPC} was obtained for Arabica green coffee in opaque packaging, brewed with filtered water at a temperature of 100 °C: 19.5 ± 1 mg {GAE}/100 g of infusion. No significant effect of temperature and water type on the {TPC} within one type of coffee was observed.

The third roasting had the highest {TPC}, ranging from 34.6 to 46.8 mg {GAE} g-1 for all methods of preparation, whereas the content for the fourth roasting ranged from 28.6 to 32.3 mg {GAE} g-1. Our results indicated that the differences in {TPC} in the beverage depended on the preparation method (P {\textless} 0.001) and the degree of roasting (P {\textless} 0.001).

The fluorescence quenching suggested the formation of a stable phenolic acid-β-{LG} complex. The thermodynamic parameters suggested that hydrophobic forces dominated the interaction process and the interaction was studied by the molecular docking. The circular dichroism spectra showed the selected phenolic acid induced secondary structure transition of the β-{LG} from β-sheet to β-turn and α-helix. Interestingly, two types of selected phenolic acids had different effects on the surface hydrophobicity of β-{LG}. Furthermore, the binding affinity decreased in the order {CaA} {\textgreater} {ChA} {\textgreater} {FA} {\textgreater} {SA} {\textgreater} {DA} {\textgreater} {GA}, which revealed that hydroxylation, methylation, steric hindrance and the type of phenolic acids affected the binding affinity. Cinnamic acid derivatives ({CaA}, {FA}, and {ChA}) exhibited a stronger binding affinity with β-{LG} than benzoic acid derivatives ({DA}, {GA}, and {SA}). The influence of methylation and the number of hydroxyl groups on the phenolic acids depended on phenolic acid type, the steric hindrance effects reduced their binding ability. The findings obtained herein are helpful to bring out the binding mechanism of phenolic acids and β-lactoglobulin.},

	abstract = {In a residential research ward coffee drinking was studied in 9 volunteer human subjects with histories of heavy coffee drinking. A series of five experiments was undertaken to characterize ad-libitum coffee consumption and to investigate the effects of manipulating coffee concentration, caffeine dose per cup, and caffeine preloads prior to coffee drinking. Manipulations were double-blind and scheduled in randomized sequences across days. When cups of coffee were freely available, coffee drinking tended to be rather regularly spaced during the day with intercup intervals becoming progressively longer throughout the day; experimental manipulations showed that this lengthening of intercup intervals was not due to accumulating caffeine levels. Number of cups of coffee consumed was an inverted U-shaped function of both coffee concentration and caffeine dose per cup; however, coffee-concentration and dose-per-cup manipulations did not produce similar effects on other measures of coffee drinking (intercup interval, time to drink a cup, within-day distribution of cups). Caffeine preload produced dose-related decreases in number of cups consumed. As a whole, these experiments provide some limited evidence for both the suppressive and the reinforcing effects of caffeine on coffee consumption. Examination of total daily coffee and caffeine intake across experiments, however, provides no evidence for precise regulation (i.e., titration) of coffee or caffeine intake.},

Seven exemplar compounds were further selected to investigate the impact of taste sub-qualities on cross-modal flavor interactions. In general, the different bitter compounds, when paired with a coffee aroma isolate, significantly modified the perception of the retronasal coffee aroma profile. Interestingly, the three bitter compounds endogenous to coffee had the most similar impact on the coffee aroma profile. Further sensory analysis of these sample sets indicated no significant effect of the bitter compounds on the orthonasal perception. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}) analysis of the volatile composition of the samples headspace also indicated negligible impact of the bitter compounds on aroma release.

Polyphenols, particularly flavonoids and phenolic acids, are of great abundance in tea and coffee and contribute a lot to their flavor and health properties. This paper reviews the polyphenol chemistry of tea and coffee, specifically their stability, and scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and reactive carbonyl species ({RCS}). During the manufacturing and brewing process, green tea and black tea polyphenols undergo epimerization and oxidation, respectively. Meanwhile, the lactonization and the polymerization of chlorogenic acid are the major causes for the degradation of polyphenols in coffee. Tea catechins, besides having antioxidant properties, have the novel characteristic of trapping reactive carbonyl species. The A ring of the catechins is the binding site for {RCS} trapping, whereas the B ring is the preferred site for antioxidation. ©2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Coffee, a complex mixture of more than 800 volatile compounds, is one of the most valuable commodity in the world, whereas caffeine and chlorogenic acids ({CGAs}) are the most common compounds. {CGAs} are mainly composed of caffeoylquinic acids ({CQAs}), dicaffeoylquinic acids ({diCQAs}), and feruloylquinic acids ({FQAs}). The major {CGAs} in coffee are neochlorogenic acid (3-{CQA}), cryptochlorogenic acid (4-{CQA}), and chlorogenic acid (5-{CQA}). Many studies have shown that it is possible to separate the isomers of {FQAs} by high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}). However, some authors have shown that it is not possible to separate 4-feruloylquinic acid (4-{FQA}) and 5-feruloylquinic acid (5-{FQA}) by {HPLC}. Therefore, the present study was designated to investigate the chromatographic problems in the determination of {CGAs} (seven isomers) and caffeine using {HPLC}-{DAD}. The values of determination coefficient (R2) calculated from external-standard calibration curves were {\textgreater}0.998. The recovery rates conducted at 3 spiking levels ranged from 99.4\% to 106.5\% for the {CGAs} and from 98.8\% to 107.1\% for the caffeine. The precision values (expressed as relative standard deviations ({RSDs})) were {\textless}7\% and {\textless}3\% for intra and interday variability, respectively. The tested procedure proved to be robust. The seven {CGAs} isomers except 4-{FQA} and 5-{FQA} were well distinguished and all gave good peak shapes. We have found that 4-{FQA} and 5-{FQA} could not be separated using {HPLC}. The method was extended to investigate the effects of different brewing conditions such as the roasting degree of green coffee bean, coffee-ground size, and numbers of boiling-water pours, on the concentration of {CGAs} and caffeine in homemade brewed coffee, using nine green coffee bean samples of different origins. It was reported that medium-roasted, fine-ground coffees brewed using three pours of boiling water were the healthiest coffee with fluent {CGAs}.},

	abstract = {The effect of the roasting degree on coffee brew melanoidin properties and formation mechanisms was studied. Coffee brew fractions differing in molecular weight (Mw) were isolated from green and light-, medium-, and dark-roasted coffee beans. Isolated fractions were characterized for their melanoidin, nitrogen, protein, phenolic groups, chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, caffeic acid, and sugar content. It was found that the melanoidin level in all fractions correlated with both the nitrogen and the protein content. The melanoidin level also correlated with the phenolic groups' level and ester-linked quinic acid level. It was concluded that proteins and chlorogenic acids should be primarily involved in melanoidin formation. Initial roasting, from green to light-roasted beans, especially led to the formation of intermediate Mw ({IMw}) melanoidins when compared to high Mw ({HMw}) melanoidins. Indications were found that this {IMw} melanoidin formation is mainly due to Maillard reactions and chlorogenic acid incorporation reactions between chlorogenic acids, sucrose, and amino acids/protein fragments. Additionally, it was found that prolonged roasting predominantly led to formation melanoidins with a high Mw. Furthermore, arabinogalactans seem to be relatively more involved in melanoidin formation than galactomannans. It was hypothesized that chromophores may be formed or attached through the arabinose moiety of arabinogalactan proteins ({AGP}). Finally, it could be concluded that galactomannans are continuously incorporated in {AGP}-melanoidins upon roasting. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The affinities of catechins for casein micelles were differentiated by the structures of catechins in the {GTP}-milk system but the {BTP}-milk system, being enhanced by a gallate group in catechins and the cis-form and weakened by a pyrogallol group. Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}) analysis showed that {TP} binding altered the secondary structures of milk proteins by reducing inter β-sheet, random coil and the large loop and increasing α-helix, intra β-sheet and turn structures, and more intense hydrophobic interaction was observed in the {BTP}-milk system. {UV}-vis spectra indicated no obvious impacts on {TP} molecules at a low concentration of milk proteins. With the increasing addition of tea infusion, {BTP} exhibited a similar fluorescence quenching ability to {GTP}, but the variance in the {ORAC} values of {BTP}-milk system was different from that of the {GTP}-milk system, suggesting that fluorescence quenching may not fully represent the interactions between polyphenols and proteins. © 2013.},

Quinides 4-11, exhibiting a coffee-typical bitter taste profile, were found to be preferentially formed under slight to medium roasting degrees and were observed to be degraded again to generate harsh bitter-tasting 4-vinylcatechol oligomers under more severe roasting conditions, thus matching the change in bitter taste quality observed by means of sensory studies. In addition, quantitative studies of the release profile of bitter compounds from ground coffee upon water percolation revealed that compounds 1-8 were rapidly extracted, dicaffeoyl quinides 9-11 were released rather slowly, and, in particular, compounds 12-17 were found to show strong retention to the ground coffee material.

We have studied the formation of {CGL} during the roasting of coffee beans in Coffea arabica cv. Bourbon; C. arabica cv. Longberry; and C. canephora cv. Robusta. Individual {CGL} levels were determined by comparison of {HPLC} peaks with those of synthetic {CGL} standards. Seven {CGL} were identified: 3-caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-{CQL}), 4-caffeoylquinic-1,5- lactone (4-{CQL}), 3-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-{pCoQL}), 4-coumaroylquinic-1,5- lactone (4-{pCoQL}), 3-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-{FQL}), 4-feruloylquinic-1,5- lactone (4-{FQL}), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-{diCQL}). 3-{CQL} was the most abundant lactone in C. arabica and C. canephora, reaching peak values of 230 ± 9 and 254 ± 4 mg/100 g (dry weight), respectively, at light medium roast (∼14\% weight loss). 4-{CQL} was the second most abundant lactone (116 ± 3 and 139 ± 2 mg/100 g, respectively. The maximum amount of {CGL} represents approximately 30\% of the available precursors. The relative levels of 3-{CQL} and 4-{CQL} in roasted coffee were reverse to those of their precursors in green coffee. This suggests that roasting causes isomerization of chlorogenic acids prior to the formation of lactones and that the levels of lactones in roasted coffee do not reflect the levels of precursors in green coffee. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

These compounds have a number of beneficial health properties related to their potent antioxidant activity as well as hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic and antiviral activities. The main groups of {CGA} found in green coffee beans include caffeoylquinic acids, dicaffeoylquinic acids, feruloylquinic acids, p-coumaroylquinic acids and mixed diesters of caffeic and ferulic acids with quinic acid, each group with at least three isomers. During coffee processing, {CGA} may be isomerized, hydrolyzed or degraded into low molecular weight compounds. The high temperatures of roasting also produce transformation of part of {CGA} into quinolactones and, along with other compounds, melanoidins.

The influence of genetic, physiological and environmental factors as well as processing on the chemical composition of coffee beans is discussed. The impact of {CGA} composition of green coffee on cup quality is also approached.

The multiple spectroscopic results and docking sresults showed that the polyphenol bindings are via hydrophilic, hydrophobic and H-bonding contacts, where larger polyphenols form more stable protein conjugates. The order of protein affinity towards polyphenol was β-casein{\textgreater} α-casein{\textgreater} β-{LG}. Loading efficacy was 30–50\% for polyphenol-protein adducts. The comparison showed milk proteins are capable of transporting tea polyphenols, which increases the bioavailability of these dietary micronutrients in solution.},

For the determination of antioxidant activity of Maillard reaction products in coffee, {TEMPO} appears to be the better radical marker. Thus the contribution of both main antioxidant active compounds (polyphenols, melanoidins) whose ratio varies with roasting conditions could be estimated. During storage experiments of coffees brews changes in antioxidant action are found to be time dependent. The content of chlorogenic acids increased significantly at higher storage temperatures, probably caused by a release from polymer structures. Additional antioxi-dant capacity of coffee melanoidins seems to be strongly influenced by atmospheric oxygen. The higher roasted sample is less vulnerable than medium or light roasted coffee. Investigations with model systems showed that among all coffee constituents the carbohydrates are mainly responsible for the formation of oxygen scavenging substances.},

	abstract = {Enzymatic oxidation of catechin and chlorogenic acid and their mixture was studied at 20 °C and at {pH} 3.5 and 6.5. The reaction products were monitored by {HPLC} with diode array detection. The rate of reaction at {pH} 6.5 was higher than at {pH} 3.5. The reaction products of catechin oxidation were dimers and other polymers of catechin with low polarity; chlorogenic acid produced mainly polymers. However, the enzymatic oxidation products of the catechin-chlorogenic acid mixture were mainly copolymers which had higher polarity than catechin or chlorogenic acid and were less brown in color than the oxidation products of catechin or chlorogenic acid alone. Catechin and chlorogenic acid are the major phenolic compounds found in many fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries, and apricots (Risch and Herr-mann, 1988). These two polyphenols are well-known sub-strates of polyphenol oxidase ({PPO}). {PPO} catalyzes the oxidation of diphenols to o-quinones, which upon further reaction leads to brown pigments. The enzymati-cally oxidized phenolic acid o-quinones were reported to oxidize other polyphenols, such as flavans, by a coupled oxidation reaction (Cheynier et al., 1988). The o-qui-none formed by enzymatic or coupled oxidation can also react with a hydroquinone to yield a condensation product (Singleton, 1987). Dimers or oligomers are reported to be generated by condensation of hydroquinone with quinone or by condensation of quiñones of phenolic acid and catechin (Cheynier et al., 1988). Oszmianski et al.

	doi = {10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.03.001},
	abstract = {Oral astringency is the dry sensation experienced in the mouth on consumption of plant-based polyphenols (catechins) found in wine and tea as well as certain fruits and vegetables. It is commonly explained as arising from the loss of lubricity owing to the precipitation of proteins from the salivary film that coats and lubricates the oral cavity. Here, we investigate this hypothesis directly by probing the impact of astringent compounds on the lubricating properties of saliva. By preadsorbing saliva onto an elastic hydrophobic substrate to form a highly lubricating and robust film under conditions designed to mimic the low pressure rubbing contacts experienced in the oral cavity (Bongaerts, Rossetti, \& Stokes, 2007), we probe the interaction of this film on exposure to solutions containing tea catechins. We examine the response of the adsorbed salivary film to polyphenol structure, concentration and temperature, as well as the influence of astringency modulating solutions consisting of a thickener (maltodextrin) and milk. We find that a significant increase in friction coefficient occurs upon exposure with epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) solutions due to a depletion of the lubricating proteins from the elastic substrates. The friction coefficient increases more rapidly with increasing {EGCG} concentration, this is in line with a corresponding increase in astringency perception. In addition, the inclusion of a hydrocolloid thickener in {EGCG} solutions caused a decrease in astringency perception probably due to specific {EGCG}-maltodextrin interaction and to an increase in viscosity, which lowers the friction coefficient between the elastic substrates. These findings show that the physical interaction of saliva proteins with {EGCG} molecules, which we probe through the loss of saliva lubricity, can be advantageously used to predict the astringent acuity of {EGCG} using our simple oral mimetic technique, supporting the hypothesis that astringency is related to a loss of lubrication. However, epicatechin ({EC}) did not alter the lubricating properties of the salivary film, although the {EC} solutions were perceived to be astringent, an observation which seems to question a simple causal dependence on oral lubrication. In addition to that, milk mitigated the astringency perception of {EGCG} solutions although considerably reducing saliva lubricity. We conclude that the depletion of saliva lubricating proteins is not necessary to obtain an astringent perception, and that astringency is unlikely to be a purely tactile percept. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This is thought to be caused by the interaction of polyphenols with basic salivary proline-rich proteins ({PRPs}). It is widely assumed that the molecular origin of astringency is the precipitation of {PRPs} following polyphenol binding and the consequent change to the mucous layer in the mouth. Here, we use a variety of biophysical techniques on a simple model system, the binding ofβ-casein to epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}). We show that at low {EGCG} ratios, small soluble polydisperse particles are formed, which aggregate to form larger particles as {EGCG} is added. There is an initial compaction of the protein as it binds to the polyphenol, but the particle subsequently increases in size as {EGCG} is added because of the incorporation of {EGCG} and then to aggregation and precipitation. These results are shown to be compatible with what is known of astringency in foodstuffs. © 2004 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Food industries are challenged to reformulate foods and beverages with higher protein contents to lower fat and sugar content. However, increasing protein concentration can reduce sensory acceptability due to astringency perception. Since the properties of food-saliva mixtures govern mouthfeel perception, understanding how saliva and protein interact is key to guide development of future protein-rich reformulations with optimal sensory attributes. Hence, this systematic review investigated protein-saliva interaction using both model and real human saliva, including a quality assessment. A literature search of five databases (Medline, Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science) was undertaken covering the last 20 years, yielding 36 604 articles. Using pre-defined criteria, this was reduced to a set of 33 articles with bulk protein solutions (n = 17), protein-stabilized emulsions (n = 13) and protein-rich food systems (n = 4). Interaction of dairy proteins, lysozyme and gelatine with model or human saliva dominated the literature. The {pH} was shown to have a strong effect on electrostatic interaction of proteins with negatively-charged salivary mucins, with greater interactions occurring below the isoelectric point of proteins. The effect of protein concentration was unclear due to the limited range of concentrations being studied. Most studies employed a 1 : 1 w/w protein : saliva ratio, which is not representative of true oral conditions. The interaction between protein and saliva appears to affect mouthfeel through aggregation and increased friction. The searches identified a gap in research on plant proteins. Accurate simulation of in vivo oral conditions should clarify understanding of protein-saliva interaction and its influence on sensory perception.},

	abstract = {Bioadhesion and bio-adsorption of proteins, glycoproteins and other biomolecules are ubiquitous phenomena in the oral cavity. While the protective role of the adsorbed salivary biomolecules on teeth (the acquired enamel pellicle) is well established, it has yet to be defined whether comparable processes occur on the desquamating oral soft tissues. The general term for these layers is pellicle, but due to the different characteristics of the coated surfaces the enamel pellicle and mucosal pellicle are their own entities. There is considerable information on the enamel pellicle, whereas only limited data are available on the mucosal pellicle. This can be attributed to the difficult standardized preparation of this biological structure. Based on the present knowledge the abundant and characteristic components of the mucosal pellicle include secreted soluble mucins ({MUC}5B, {MUC}7), membrane-associated epithelial mucins ({MUC}1), and to a lesser degree {CA} {VI}, {sIgA}, and cystatin. However, it seems to be of completely different ultrastructure as compared with the enamel pellicle. Since it is comprised of larger glycoproteins retaining water, it might be considered as a hydrogel, and it appears to have a lower tenacity than the enamel pellicle. Maturation and turnover are influenced by the delivery of salivary proteins, by the flow of saliva and the underlying desquamating oral epithelium. Its probable functions include lubrication and moisture retention. In general, the mucosal pellicle can be regarded as an underestimated key player in oral physiology.},

	doi = {10.1111/1750-3841.12342},
	abstract = {The hedonic 9-point scale was designed to compare palatability among different food items; however, it has also been used occasionally to compare individuals and groups. Such comparisons can be invalid because scale labels (for example, "like extremely") can denote systematically different hedonic intensities across some groups. Addressing this problem, the hedonic general Labeled Magnitude Scale ({gLMS}) frames affective experience in terms of the strongest imaginable liking/disliking of any kind, which can yield valid group comparisons of food palatability provided extreme hedonic experiences are unrelated to food. For each scale, 200 panelists rated affect for remembered food products (including favorite and least favorite foods) and sampled foods; they also sampled taste stimuli (quinine, sucrose, {NaCl}, citric acid) and rated their intensity. Finally, subjects identified experiences representing the endpoints of the hedonic {gLMS}. Both scales were similar in their ability to detect within-subject hedonic differences across a range of food experiences, but group comparisons favored the hedonic {gLMS}. With the 9-point scale, extreme labels were strongly associated with extremes in food affect. In contrast, {gLMS} data showed that scale extremes referenced nonfood experiences. Perceived taste intensity significantly influenced differences in food liking/disliking (for example, those experiencing the most intense tastes, called supertasters, showed more extreme liking and disliking for their favorite and least favorite foods). Scales like the hedonic {gLMS} are suitable for across-group comparisons of food palatability. Practical Application: Meaningful consumer evaluation requires scaling methods able to show individual and group differences in affective response. For studies of food palatability, the traditional 9-point scale obscures hedonic differences associated with oral sensory intensity (for example, supertasters and others), while the general Labeled Magnitude Scale permits their expression.},

	abstract = {Phenolic acids have recently gained substantial attention due to their various practical, biological and pharmacological effects. Chlorogenic Acid ({CGA}, 3-{CQA}) is a most abundant isomer among caffeoylquinic acid isomers (3-, 4-, and 5-{CQA}), that currently known as 5-{CQA} as per guidelines of {IUPAC}. It is one of the most available acids among phenolic acid compounds which can be naturally found in green coffee extracts and tea. {CGA} is an important and biologically active dietary polyphenol, playing several important and therapeutic roles such as antioxidant activity, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, antiviral, anti-microbial, anti-hypertension, free radicals scavenger and a central nervous system ({CNS}) stimulator. In addition, it has been found that {CGA} could modulate lipid metabolism and glucose in both genetically and healthy metabolic related disorders. It is speculated that {CGA} can perform crucial roles in lipid and glucose metabolism regulation and thus help to treat many disorders such as hepatic steatosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity as well. Furthermore, this phenolic acid ({CGA}) causes hepatoprotective effects by protecting animals from chemical or lipopolysaccharide-induced injuries. The hypocholesterolemic influence of {CGA} can result from the altered metabolism of nutrients, including amino acids, glucose and fatty acids ({FA}). The purpose of this review was to broaden the scope of knowledge of researchers to conduct more studies on this subject to both unveil and optimize its biological and pharmacological effects. As a result, {CGA} may be practically used as a natural safeguard food additive to replace the synthetic antibiotics and thereby reduce the medicinal cost.},

	abstract = {Structural assignment of natural products has for decades been the prerogative of {NMR} spectroscopy. In particular, unambiguous assignment of aspects of regio- and stereochemistry in complex natural product structures has on numerous occasions been shown to be a unique strength of {NMR} spectroscopy. In contrast, for decades mass spectrometry has been prejudicially considered to be isomer blind. Recent advances have, however, clearly demonstrated that certain mass spectrometric techniques are able to clearly distinguish between isomeric compounds and also that an in-depth understanding of fragmentation processes leads to surprising levels of structure assignment confidence. In comparison to {NMR} spectroscopy, mass spectrometry offers a variety of obvious advantages in natural product chemistry including enhanced sensitivity; ease of coupling to separation techniques, in particular liquid chromatography; and the ability to isolate individual ions from a complex mixture in the gas phase. Hence, especially for complex samples containing natural products as minor constituents, structure elucidation by mass spectrometry constitutes the only practical access to natural product structures. Within the chapter, we review mass spectrometric methods currently employed to assign isomeric structures including tandem mass spectrometry, energy-resolved mass spectrometry, and ion mobility mass spectrometry applied to natural product research. The advantages, practical implications, limitations, and future prospects of the methods are discussed. In the next section, we review selected classes of natural products in which successful structure elucidation by mass spectrometry has been demonstrated. We limit ourselves to the discussion of representative examples in which {MS} data lead to definite unambiguous structure assignment. Examples from the literature include chlorogenic acids, quinic and shikimic acid derivatives, proanthocyanidins, hydroxylactones, sulfated saccharides, phenolic acid esters of carbohydrates, and polyketides. This chapter is organized in a tutorial style, allowing other researchers to employ these methods in their own research.},

	abstract = {The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as chlorogenic acids ({CGA}) and, consequently, their 1,5-γ-quinolactones ({CGL}) in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of decaffeination processing on {CGA} and {CGL} levels of green and roasted arabica coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16\% average increase in the levels of total {CGA} in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237\% increase in {CGL} direct precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18\% in {CGL} levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more consistent with observed levels of total {CGA} than with those of {CGL} direct precursors in green samples. On the other hand, {CGA} levels in roasted coffee were 3-9\% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although differences in {CGA} and {CGL} contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final beverage, suggesting the need for further study. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Detection thresholds ({DTs}) were determined using the staircase method for surface roughness from stainless steel coupons (Ra; 0.177-0.465 μm) and astringency elicited by epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}; 0-1.64 {mM}) and tannic acid ({TA}; 0-0.71 {mM}) from 30 individuals.

Variability in threshold roughness sensitivity enabled dividing subjects into high ({RHi}; n = 16) and low ({RLo}; n = 14) sensitivity groups; however, no significant differences in age, {FPD}, or {SF} were observed across these cohorts.

	abstract = {Salivary protein difference value ({SP} D-value) is a quantitative measure of salivary protein replenishment, which reportedly relates to individual differences in perceived astringency. This in vitro measure is calculated as the difference in total salivary protein before (S1) and after (S2) stimulation with tannic acid, with a greater absolute value (S2-S1) indicating less protein replenishment. Others report that this measure predicts perceived astringency and liking of liquid model systems and beverages containing added polyphenols. Whether this relationship generalizes to astringent compounds other than polyphenols, or to solid foods is unknown. Here, the associations between {SP} D-values and perceived astringency and overall liking/disliking for alum and tannic acid (experiment 1) as well as solid chocolate-flavored compound coating with added tannic acid or grape seed extract ({GSE}) (experiment 2) were examined. In both experiments, participants (n = 84 and 81, respectively) indicated perceived intensity of astringency, bitterness, sweetness, and sourness, and degree of liking of either aqueous solutions, or solid chocolate-flavored compound coating with added astringents. Data were analyzed via linear regression, and as discrete groups for comparison to prior work. Three discrete groups were formed based on first and third quartile splits of the {SP} D-value distribution: low ({LR}), medium ({MR}), and high responding ({HR}) individuals. In experiment 1, significantly higher mean astringency ratings were observed for the {HR} as compared to the {LR}/{MR} groups for alum and tannic acid, confirming and extending prior work. In experiment 2, significantly higher mean astringency ratings were also observed for {HR} as compared to {LR} groups in solid chocolate-flavored compound containing added tannic acid or {GSE}. Significant differences in liking were found between {HR} and {LR} groups for alum and tannic acid in water, but no significant differences in liking were observed for chocolate-flavored compound samples. A significant linear relationship between {SP} D-values and perceived astringency was observed for both alum and tannic acid (p's {\textless} 0.001), although the variance explained was relatively low (R2 = 0.33 and 0.29, respectively). In the solid chocolate-flavored compound spiked with either tannic acid or {GSE}, the relationship was not significant (p = 0.17 and 0.30; R2 = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Due to the weak associations overall, and the lack of significant differences in perception of astringency between the {MR} and {LR} groups, we conclude that {SP} D-values are not a strong predictor of astringency, especially in solid, high-fat foods. Additional research investigating alternative methods for quantifying individual differences in astringency, as well as exploring the underlying complexities of this percept appears warranted.},

Treatment of the dibromide, obtained by the addition of bromine to cyclohexa-1,4-diene, with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-{CPBA}) yielded the dibromoepoxide, which was successfully converted to the desired dibromodiol by treatment with sulfuric acid. The resulting diol was reacted with 2,2-dimethoxypropane to give the dibromoketal. Hydrogen bromide elimination with {NaOMe} gave the key compound methoxyketal, rel-(3aS,5R,7aS)-5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-3a,4,5,7a- tetrahydrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole. The second key compound, an isomeric methoxyketal, was prepared by ketalization of 4,5-dibromocyclohexane-1,2-diol with dimethoxypropane followed by the reaction with {NaOMe}. Deprotection of ketal functionality with sulfuric acid followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine resulted in the formation of diacetate rel-(1S,2R,5R)-5- methoxycyclohex-3-ene-1,2-diyl diacetate. Epoxidation of the double bonds in isomeric methoxy diacetates and cis-hydroxylation followed by epoxide-opening and deprotection resulted in the formation of various quercitol derivatives. The inhibition activity of eleven quercitols, methoxyquercitols and bromoquercitols was tested against α-glycosidase. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

This happens when an individual decision-maker attempts to digest information exceeding its processing capacity. Highly integrated groups, such as social insect colonies, make consensus decisions that combine the efforts of many members, suggesting that these groups can overcome individual limitations [2-4]. Here we report that an ant colony choosing a new nest site is less vulnerable to cognitive overload than an isolated ant making this decision on her own. We traced this improvement to differences in individual behavior. In whole colonies, each ant assesses only a small subset of available sites, and the colony combines their efforts to thoroughly explore all options. An isolated ant, on the other hand, must personally assess a larger number of sites to approach the same level of option coverage. By sharing the burden of assessment, the colony avoids overtaxing the abilities of its members. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The control condition simulated a coffeehouse environment complete with the sights, sounds and smells commonly experienced in that venue. A laboratory setting, construction noise, and laundry detergent represented the individual incongruent visual, auditory, and aroma streams, respectively. Results revealed that olfactory information had a lesser priority than visual or auditory information in the simulated environments when assessed by subject's ability to recall encountered information streams.

	abstract = {The extraction kinetics and equilibrium concentrations of caffeine and 3-chlorogenic acid (3-{CGA}) in cold brew coffee were investigated by brewing four coffee samples (dark roast/medium grind, dark roast/ coarse grind, medium roast/medium grind, medium roast/coarse grind) using cold and hot methods. 3-{CGA} and caffeine were found at higher concentrations in cold brew coffee made with medium roast coffees, rather than dark roast. The grind size did not impact 3-{CGA} and caffeine concentrations of cold brew samples significantly, indicating that the rate determining step in extraction for these compounds did not depend on surface area. Caffeine concentrations in cold brew coarse grind samples were substantially higher than their hot brew counterparts. 3-{CGA} concentrations and {pH} were comparable between cold and hot brews. This work suggests that the difference in acidity of cold brew coffee is likely not due to 3-{CGA} or caffeine concentrations considering that most acids in coffee are highly soluble and extract quickly. It was determined that caffeine and 3-{CGA} concentrations reached equilibrium according to first order kinetics between 6 and 7 hours in all cold brew samples instead of 10 to 24 hours outlined in typical cold brew methods. In 2015, domestic coffee consumption in the United States reached an estimated 1.4 billion kg/year, making it the second largest coffee market in the world after the European Union 1. The majority of coffee consumed in the United States is prepared through various hot brewing methods, whereby the hot water solubilizes and extracts numerous organic compounds from the roasted coffee grounds. However, cold brew coffee preparation techniques have grown in popularity, both in at-home and consumer (or ready-to-drink, {RTD}) markets. Market researcher, {StudyLogic}, estimates that coffee shop sales of hot coffee fell 3\% in 2016, while cold brewed coffee sales were up nearly 80\% over the previous year's record 2. Roast Magazine reports a 460\% increase in retail sales of refrigerated cold brew coffee from 2015 to 2017, generating \$38 million in 2017 alone 3. In an effort to capitalize on this rapidly growing market, Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks, and other commercial coffee vendors have invested in {RTD} cold brew coffee beverages and are suggesting that colder, slower brewing processes alter flavor, aroma, and bioactive compounds 4. Starbucks markets that cold brew coffee is sweeter, smoother, with a more full-bodied flavor than conventionally brewed coffee 5. Dunkin' Donuts claims that, "cold brew is less acidic and naturally sweeter than regular coffee, so it can easily be consumed black" 6. Cold brew coffee, not to be confused with iced coffee (which is hot brewed coffee served over ice), is prepared at room temperature (20 to 25 °C or colder) over a longer time period than traditional hot brewing methods, typically steeping times range from 8 to 24 hours 7-10. Brewing coffee is an extraction process dependent on a multitude of variables such as water volume, water temperature, diameter of the coffee grind particles, the poros-ity of the coffee grind matrix, the pore network between coffee grind particles, and brewing time. Temperature often significantly influences compounds aqueous solubility, so differences in brewing temperatures may result in significantly different compositions in hot brew and cold brew coffees. Additionally, the longer brewing times of cold brew coffee may affect the final composition of cold brew coffee if the diffusion of the compounds across the grind matrix is a kinetically limiting phenomenon. An extensive body of literature exists detailing the chemistry of hot brewed coffee, including quantifying the caffeine concentration as a function of hot water brewing method 11-14.

	abstract = {The role of roasting in cold brew coffee chemistry is poorly understood. The brewing temperature influences extraction processes and may have varying effects across the roast spectrum. To understand the relationship between brew temperature and roast temperature, hot and cold brew coffees were prepared from Arabica Columbian coffee beans roasted to light, medium, and dark levels. Chemical and physical parameters were measured to investigate the relationships among degree of roast, water temperature, and key characteristics of resulting coffees. Cold brew coffees showed differential extraction marked by decreased acidity, lower concentration of browned compounds, and fewer {TDS} indicating that cold water brewing extracts some compounds less effectively than hot water brewing. Compounds in coffee did exhibit sensitivity to degree of roast, with darker roasts resulting in decreased concentrations for both hot and cold brew coffees. Total antioxidant capacity ({TAC}) was only sensitive to degree of roast in cold brew coffees, while hot brew coffees had a constant {TAC} for all three roast levels. This indicates that the solid bean matrix and its chemical constituents interact with cold water differently than with hot water. Surface wetting, pore dynamics, and solubility all contribute to the extraction potential during brewing and are all functions of water temperature.},

	abstract = {In most cultures, people ingest a variety of astringent foods and beverages during meals, but the reasons for this practice are unclear. Many popular beliefs and heuristics, such as high tannin wines should be balanced with fatty foods, for example 'red wine with red meat', suggest that astringents such as pickles, sorbets, wines, and teas 'cleanse' the palate while eating. Oral astringents elicit 'dry, rough' sensations [1], in part, by breaking down mucinous lubricating proteins in saliva [2,3]. The introduction of oral lubricants, including fats, partially diminishes strong astringent sensations [4,5]. Thus, it appears that astringency and fattiness can oppose each other perceptually on an oral rheological spectrum. Most teas, wines, and 'palate cleansers', however, are only mildly astringent and an explanation of how they could oppose the fattiness of meals is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that weakly astringent stimuli can elicit strong sensations after repeated sampling. Astringency builds with exposures [6] to an asymptotic level determined by the structure and concentration of the compound. We also establish that multiple sips of a mild astringent solution, similar to a wine or tea, decrease oral fat sensations elicited by fatty food consumption when astringent and fatty stimuli alternate, mimicking the patterning that occurs during a real meal. Consequently, we reveal a principle underlying the international practice of 'palate cleansing'. Repeatedly alternating samples of astringent beverages with fatty foods yielded ratings of fattiness and astringency that were lower than if rinsing with water or if presented alone without alternation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Scope and approach: This review focuses on interpreting the contribution that various parameters have during the coffee extraction process (coffee brewing). Coffee brewing methods and their extraction parameters were analysed in terms of phenomenological explanations and their effect on the physicochemical and flavour characteristics of brewed coffee. Key findings and conclusions: Many brewing methods have been developed to achieve a myriad of coffee flavour characteristics. Although several well-known brewing techniques have been adopted in the coffee industry, little associated relevant scientific data is available. Overall, these methods vary by extraction pressure, coffee/water ratio, water quality, contact time, particle size distribution, and temperature. An overview shows that all these factors modify the extraction of bioactive and volatile compounds that affect the flavour profile of the beverage. However, more in-depth explanation of the mass and energy transport phenomena would be useful to improve the understanding of the relationship between extraction variables and coffee flavour. Thus, phenomenological explanations are included to impart a better understanding of physicochemical and flavour changes in coffee beverages. Additionally, several gaps in knowledge relating to the extraction process are identified; and new trends in coffee extraction, including the cold brew method, are also discussed.},

Fourteen and 16 spiked samples of experiments 1 and 2, respectively, were sensory evaluated together with control samples to assess the intensity of the six aroma vectors, sourness, bitterness and astringency. Evaluation was performed using a descriptive analysis technique based on intensity rating by three groups of participants with different levels of expertise. The effect of the addition of one aroma vector, sourness or bitterness on bitter or astringent intensity was evaluated by {ANOVA}. No significant effect of aroma, sourness or bitterness was observed for astringent intensity, confirming that in these red wines, cross-modal interactions are not relevant in astringency. Bitter-aroma interactions were demonstrated for animal aroma just for less-experienced consumers (novices) attributed to a hedonic synergism. Significant decreases in bitterness due to sour vector were observed regardless consumer expertise. This could be explained in terms of interactions at both cognitive and receptor level.},

A panel of 12 assessors participated in the study; they were familiarised with the perceptual characters of the stimuli individually, as well as practise on scale usage for rating attribute intensities. Three sensory attributes (flavour, astringency and sourness intensity) were evaluated for each alum-volatile mixture in aqueous solutions, in duplicate.

Astringency of alum was significantly (p = 0.014) enhanced by {IBMP}, in particular at 4 ng/L but not at 14 ng/L. The mechanisms behind orange flavour enhancement may stem from the sourness of alum as opposed to its astringency, but this requires further confirmatory tests.

Indeed, the most important and frequent tasks that our brain deals with every day are foraging and feeding. The recent studies by psychologists and cognitive neuroscientist revealed how complex multisensory rely on the integration of cues from all the human senses in any flavor experiences. The perception of flavor is multisensory and involves combinations of gustatory and olfactory stimuli. The cross-modal mapping between these modalities needs to be more explored in the virtual environment and simulation, especially in liquid food. In this paper, we present a customized wearable Augmented Reality ({AR}) system and olfaction display to study the effect of vision and olfaction on the gustatory sense. A user experiment and extensive analysis conducted to study the influence of each stimulus on the overall flavor, including other factors like age, previous experience in Virtual Reality ({VR})/{AR}, and beverage consumption. The result showed that smell contributes strongly to the flavor with less contribution to the vision. However, the combination of these stimuli can deliver richer experience and a higher belief rate. Beverage consumption had a significant effect on the flavor belief rate. Experience is correlated with stimulus and age is correlated with belief rate, and both indirectly affected the belief rate.},

When 25\% milk was added to coffee, up to 40\% of coffee chlorogenic acid were found to be bound to dairy proteins, using an ultrafiltration technique. However, neither milk addition nor spray-drying had a significant effect on beverage antioxidant power, evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-pycrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}), 2-2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride ({AAPH}), and total antioxidant capacity ({TAC}) tests.

	abstract = {To date, there exists a debate on the effect of milk added to coffee infusions/beverages concerning the nutritional quality of coffee and the functional properties of its phenolic compounds. Yet, the full nutritional quality and functional properties of a coffee beverage without a significant negative impact on its sensorial profile are highly desired by the consumers. Negative/masking, positive, and neutral effects of milk on the antioxidant activity and bioavailability of coffee phenolics (particularly, chlorogenic acids) have been reported. Some potential factors including the type and amount of milk added, type of coffee beverage, the composition of both milk (protein and fat) and coffee (phenolic compounds), preparation method, assays used to measure antioxidant properties, and sampling size may account for the various reported findings. Interactions between phenolic compounds in coffee and milk proteins could account as the main responsible aspect for the reported masking/negative impact of milk on the antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility/bioavailability of coffee bioactives. However, considering the interactions between milk components and coffee phenolics, which result in the loss of their functionality, the role of milk fat globules and the milk fat globule membrane can also be crucial, but this has not been addressed in the literature so far.Highlights In most cases, milk is added to the coffee beverages in several various ways. Effect of milk on the nutritional/functional properties of coffee is controversial. Enough evidence suggests negative effects of milk addition on properties of coffee. Interactions of coffee phenolics and milk proteins could account as the main aspect. The role of milk fat globules and milk fat globule membrane may also be crucial.},

Volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) are released from the food matrix and then reach the receptors located in the nasal cavity, leading to their perception. These steps are closely dependent on the physicochemical properties of the volatile compounds and the food matrix, but also on human physiology. Among the different physiological parameters involved, the literature reports that saliva has various effects on {VOCs} and therefore appears as a major actor impacting the perception of aroma. This article reviews how saliva takes part in aroma release, considering both in vitro and in vivo approaches, and how it may affect perception. It describes the direct mechanisms (molecular interactions, enzymatic conversion, salting-out effect, dilution) involving salivary components (salts, proteins including enzymes, microbiota) that can modify the release of aroma compounds. It also considers the indirect impact of saliva, such as changes of aroma diffusion through modification of the physicochemical properties of the food matrix.},

The index is based on signal detection theory and is free of the response bias that can invalidate difference testing protocols, including categorization and same-different and A-Not A tests. It is also a nonparametric analysis, making no assumptions about sensory distributions, and is simple to compute and understand. The R-Index is also flexible in its application. Methods based on R-Index analysis have been used as detection and sensory difference tests, as simple alternatives to hedonic scaling, and for themeasurement of consumer concepts.

	title = {Integration of olfactory and gustatory chemosignals in the insular cortex},
	abstract = {Background Flavor is an integrative sensation comprised of taste, odor, and mouthfeel. The interaction between olfactory cues and taste is particularly important for flavor formation. Because odor information is conveyed to the insular cortex ({IC}), the integration of olfactory and gustatory chemosignals may be performed in the {IC}. However, little is known about how these chemosignals converge in the {IC}. In this review, we explore the mechanisms underlying signal integration in the {IC}, and we summarize several studies relevant to this issue. Some morphological findings have indicated the presence of bidirectional connections between the piriform cortex ({PC}) and {IC}. Clarifying the functional interactions between these cortices, some groups, including ours, have demonstrated the spatiotemporal dynamics of excitatory propagation induced by simultaneously stimulating olfactory and gustatory pathways, using an in vivo optical imaging technique with a voltage sensitive dye. Highlights In our study, simultaneous stimulation of olfactory and gustatory pathways showed spatially additive responding regions within the {PC} and {IC}. Responses of the agranular {IC} ({AI}) to simultaneous stimulation showed a synergistic increase in amplitudes, whereas the responses in other areas were of the same order of magnitude as the responses to the single stimulation of either olfactory or gustatory pathway. Conclusion Several studies, including {fMRI} analyses in human and animal studies, suggest that the {IC} directly integrates olfactory and gustatory chemical signals. In particular, our study raises the possibility that the {AI} plays an important role in integrating olfactory and gustatory signals.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that congruent food odors are enhanced by sweet taste, but not by sour or bitter taste. This raises questions regarding the underlying conditions of retronasal odor enhancement by taste. We speculate that a taste quality that signals the presence of "nutritive" or "beneficial" substances (e.g., sweet carbohydrate), as opposed to potentially harmful substances (e.g., toxins, spoilage), can enhance a congruent odor. This study aimed to investigate this possibility by testing two other taste qualities, saltiness and umami, which signal the presence of minerals and protein. The study also examined the possible occurrence of saltiness and umami enhancement by odors and factors that may affect both taste and odor enhancement. Over five sessions, subjects rated (1) intensities of saltiness, bitterness, umami, and specific odor of tastants ({NaCl}, {MSG}, {MPG}, caffeine), odorants (chicken, soy sauce odor), and all possible binary mixtures, (2) degree of liking/disliking of the odorants in the absence and presence of the tastants, (3) degree of congruency of odorants alone and with tastants, and (4) degree of perceptual similarity between tastants and odorants. Results showed that saltiness and umami enhanced chicken and soy sauce odor intensities, but the odors did not enhance saltiness and umami intensities. Importantly, the degree of odor enhancement was highly correlated with the degree of taste-odor congruency, but less so with the degree of perceptual similarity between taste and odor. These findings confirm our hypotheses that the quality of taste dictates the ability to enhance food odors and that the degree of taste-odor congruency can modulate the degree of odor enhancement.},

This study aimed to determine whether hand-feel touch cues of cup-sleeve materials could be associated with imagined (Study 1) and consumed (Study 2) basic tastes, and thereby affect the perception of brewed coffee (Study 3). Participants were asked to evaluate twelve different cup-sleeve materials with respect to evoked emotions and their degree of matching with each of the four basic taste qualities and brewed coffee-related flavor attributes (Study 1). Individual cup-sleeve materials were found to be more associated with specific taste qualities, coffee-related flavors, and emotions. Hand-feel touch cues of different sleeves were also found to be associated with taste qualities consumed (Study 2). For example, towel, linen, stainless steel, and cardboard materials were matched with sweet, salty, sour, and bitter taste qualities, respectively. Specific physical characteristics of cup-sleeve materials were found to be involved in mediating such cross-modal associations between hand-feel touch and taste cues. In Study 3, participants were asked to evaluate brewed coffee samples in paper cups both with cardboard sleeves and those made from the other test materials (towel, linen, and stainless steel). While participants rated black coffee samples with a towel sleeve less bitter than those with a cardboard sleeve, such differences were not observed in other pairwise comparisons. In conclusion, this study provided empirical evidence that hand-feel touch cues can be associated with specific taste or coffee-related flavor attributes, thereby modulating consumer perception of brewed coffee.},

	abstract = {Enhancement of retronasal odors by sucrose has been shown to be a reliable perceptual phenomenon of taste-odor interactions. It is unknown, however, whether stimulus intensity modulates the degree of odor enhancement. The present study was therefore designed to investigate how the intensity of odor and taste alone affects the degree of odor enhancement. In the first experiment, subjects rated the intensities of taste and odor for aqueous solutions of sucrose and citral at three concentrations, both alone and in binary mixtures. The results showed that sucrose significantly increased the "citrus" ratings to an extent that was inversely related to the intensity of citral alone. Interestingly, the increase in sucrose intensity had insignificant effects on odor enhancement. To test the reliability of the relationship between odor intensity and the degree of enhancement, a second experiment was conducted in which subjects inhaled three concentrations of citral in vapor phase via the mouth while tasting sucrose. This procedure also provided an opportunity to rule out the possibility that the odor enhancement is the result of, at least in part, physicochemical interactions between sucrose and volatiles. Consistent with the previous results, the presence of sucrose in the mouth significantly enhanced the "citrus" ratings compared to when citral was inhaled alone, and the odor intensity relationship was preserved. These findings demonstrate that odor enhancement by sucrose is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs independent of physicochemical interactions between flavor components and that the degree of enhancement is greater when retronasal odors are weak. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The objective of this review is to evaluate the influence of six factors on coffee volatiles. At present, the poor aroma from robusta or low-quality arabica coffee can be significantly improved by advanced technology, and this subject will continue to be further studied. On the other hand, inoculating various starter cultures in green coffee beans has become a popular research direction for promoting coffee aroma and flavor. Several surveys have indicated that shade and altitude can affect the content of coffee aroma precursors and volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}), which remain to be fully elucidated. The emergence of the new roasting process has greatly enriched the aroma composition of coffee. Cold-brew coffee is one of the most popular trends in coffee extraction currently, and its influence on coffee aroma is worthy of in-depth and detailed study. Omics technology will be one of the most important means to analyze coffee aroma components and their quality formation mechanism. A better understanding of the effect of each parameter on {VOCs} would assist coffee researchers and producers in the optimal selection of post-harvest parameters that favor the continuous production of flavorful and top-class coffee beans and beverages. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.},

	abstract = {Psychophysical studies of interactions between retronasal olfaction and taste have focused most often on the enhancement of tastes by odors, which has been attributed primarily to a response bias (i.e., halo dumping). Based upon preliminary evidence that retronasal odors could also be enhanced by taste, the present study measured both forms of enhancement using appropriate response categories. In the first experiment, subjects rated taste ("sweet," "sour," "salty," and "bitter") and odor ("other") intensity for aqueous samples of 3 tastants (sucrose, {NaCl}, and citric acid) and 3 odorants (vanillin, citral, and furaneol), both alone and in taste-odor mixtures. The results showed that sucrose, but not the other taste stimuli, significantly increased the perceived intensity of all 3 odors. Enhancement of tastes by odors was inconsistent and generally weaker than enhancement of odors by sucrose. A second experiment used a flavored beverage and a custard dessert to test whether the findings from the first experiment would hold for the perception of actual foods. Adding sucrose significantly enhanced the intensity of "cherry" and "vanilla" flavors, whereas adding vanillin did not significantly enhance the intensity of sweetness. It is proposed that enhancement of retronasal odors by a sweet stimulus results from an adaptive sensory mechanism that serves to increase the salience of the flavor of nutritive foods. © The Author 2011.

Among the detected compounds, furans were present in the highest levels, followed by lactones. Furfuryl alcohol followed by ɣ-butyrolactone, pyridine, hexadecanoic acid, maltol, 2-methyl pyrazine and furfuryl acetate were found in large amounts in both coffee brews. It was observed that the volatile profiles of both samples were quite similar. Based on the odor activity values ({OAVs}), 13 volatile compounds presented {OAVs} greater than 1 and guaiacol, 2,3-butanedione and furfuryl acetate were the highest {OAVs} in both coffee samples.

The results of this first study provide valuable information for understanding the aroma and odor activity value differences between Turkish coffee and French press coffee. The liquid–liquid extraction technique for isolation followed by analysis and identification of those compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is an effective practical application tool for volatile description in coffee samples.

	abstract = {The flavour perception of cheese results from complex sensory interactions between tastes and aromas. Using a model cheese solution, this study investigated perceived interactions between each of five basic tastes and a cheese aroma mixture containing ten volatile compounds commonly found in cheese. The five tastes - sucrose (sweetness), sodium chloride ({NaCl}) (saltiness), monosodium glutamate ({MSG}) (umami), lactic acid (sourness), and caffeine (bitterness) - were individually mixed with cheese aroma in water using a 5 taste level (0.2 log series) by 3 aroma level (0.5 log series) design. Aroma controls with no added taste were also included. This resulted in 18 samples for each single taste-aroma combination. An additional 18 samples were produced using a mixture of all 5 tastes with the 3 aroma levels. A panel of trained assessors (n=10) evaluated cheese flavour intensity and taste intensity using 100 point line scales. Evaluation was carried out in duplicate, with samples grouped by taste type; 1 evaluation session per taste per replicate. Within type, order of presentation was balanced, and taste type order was randomised between replicates. Cheese flavour intensity was enhanced by sucrose and {NaCl}, while being suppressed by lactic acid. {NaCl} enhanced cheese flavour intensity the most at high aroma level, while lactic acid suppressed the most at low aroma level. When {MSG} level was increased, cheese flavour intensity was enhanced at both low and medium aroma levels, but was suppressed at the high aroma level. The greatest enhancement of cheese flavour intensity was found with the mixture of 5 tastes. Aroma significantly enhanced umami and bitterness, but did not enhance sweetness, saltiness, or sourness. This study showed that the perceived interaction between taste and cheese aroma depended on taste type and on the concentration levels of both taste type and aroma. The mixture of tastes was more effective at enhancing cheese flavour intensity than single tastes. This study provides knowledge that will underpin further study of taste-aroma interactions in a model cheese that aims to optimise cheese flavour intensity and character. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Emerging statistical methodologies are discussed along with their role in tying together discrete studies to reveal important flavor compounds that are either positively or negatively associated with consumer liking. Coffee is very widely studied, a fact that may be partially ascribed to its immense popularity in modern society. To this end, more than 100 sensory lexicons have been developed and implemented to describe specific coffee characteristics and around 1,000 volatile compounds have been identified in coffee. As a remarkably complex sample coffee has provided substantial impetus for adoption of new analytical approaches such as multidimensional separation technologies. This review describes common and emerging analytical techniques that have been employed for coffee analysis, with a particular emphasis placed on those associated with determination of volatile compounds.

	abstract = {Polyphenols (tannins) in the diet not only precipitate oral proteins, producing an astringent sensation, but also interact with dietary proteins and digestive enzymes in the gut, resulting in a variety of antinutritive and toxic effects. Salivary proline-rich proteins ({PRPs}), which are secreted into the oral cavity, form complexes with and precipitate dietary polyphenols, and thus, they constitute the primary mammalian defense directed against ingested tannins. In order to characterize the interaction, {NMR} studies were performed which involved titrating a series of polyphenols into a synthetic 19-residue {PRP} fragment. The results show that the predominant mode of association is a hydrophobic stacking of the polyphenol ring against the {proS} face of proline and that the first proline residue of a Pro-Pro sequence is a particularly favored binding site. Measurement of dissociation constants indicates that the larger and more complex polyphenols interact more strongly with the {PRP} fragment; the order of binding affinity was determined as procyanidin dimer B-2 {\textgreater} pentagalloylglucose {\textgreater} trigalloylglucose {\textgreater}{\textgreater} proanthocyanidin monomer (-)-epicatechin ≈ propyl gallate. Smaller polyphenols can bind with one phenolic ring stacked against each proline residue, whereas larger polyphenols occupy two or three consecutive prolines. The more complex polyphenols interact with the {PRP} fragment in a multidentate fashion; moreover, they self-associate or stack when bound. Thus, a model is proposed in which multiple polyphenol/polyphenol and polyphenol/ {PRP} interactions act cooperatively to achieve precipitation.},

Cold brewing (dripping and immersion) and hot brewing (French press) methods were studied to understand the effects of water temperature and technical brewing method conditions on the chemical compound extraction in coffees roasted at high-temperature short time ({HTST}) and low-temperature long time ({LTLT}). The results showed that coffee beverages were clearly differentiated concerning the roasting profile when hot water was used (90 ± 3 °C) in brewing. Separation of beverages according to the water temperature used in brewing was observed. Notably, hot brewing coffees were distinguished from cold brewing (19 ± 2 °C) based on a higher titratable acidity and abundance of some furan compounds. The non-volatile extraction rate increased at higher brewing temperatures. At the same brewing temperature, dripping exhibited a higher extraction rate than immersion brewing, which suggests that the coffee extraction process is affected by the design and operation of the cold brewing system. Coffee beverages brewed with {HTST} and cold dripping displayed the highest value in total dissolved solids ({TDS}), extraction yield, as well as the highest caffeine, trigonelline, 4- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids ({CQAs}) contents. Regardless of the roasting profile, coffees brewed by cold dripping were perceived with more bitter and roasted flavors. In contrast, cold immersion and hot coffee beverages showed remarkable sweetness, nutty, caramel, and malt attributes. In turn, these attributes showed an inverse correlation with caffeine concentration, trigonelline, {CQAs}, and {TDS}. The findings of this study demonstrate that volatile and non-volatile compounds present in roasted coffee depend on time-temperature roasting conditions; in turn, their presence in the resulting beverages are related to the extraction of the operational conditions of coffee brewing methods.},

The aim of this study is twofold: first, we characterize four coffees by sensory descriptive analysis ({DA}) where assessors evaluated samples before and after tasting aqueous solutions representing five basic tastes ({BT}); secondly, we investigate consumers’ liking of the same four coffees, both in isolation and when paired with a sweet or savory food. The {DA} results showed that exposure to all {BT} influenced the subsequent perceived attribute intensity of coffee; however, the direction of the effect was dependent on the {BT}, the coffee, and the specific sensory attribute. Most sensory attribute intensities decreased after exposure to the {BT}, only exposure to the {BT} bitter increased the intensity of more attributes than it decreased. The consumer test showed that preference for the coffee were mostly related to intrinsic characteristics of the samples as over half of the data variance in consumer liking (56\%) related to the difference between samples described by fruity, floral and berry attributes, and samples described by chocolate, nutty and sweet attributes. Pairing coffee with either sweet or savory food accounted for an additional 20\% of the variance in liking. Drivers of liking were sample-specific, with one common denominator: when consumers perceive the coffee as sour, they liked it significantly less. Overall, with respect to coffee-food pairing, coffee characterized as having chocolate, nutty, sweet notes are more suitable to be paired with food than coffees characterized as fruity, floral, berry.},

	abstract = {The flavor of food is one of the most significant characteristics that determine food quality and consumer acceptance. Flavor is the sensory impression of a substance (e.g. a food) by the chemical and trigeminal senses. Flavor perception results from multisensory interactions and ultimate central integration, with smell and taste being the key contributors. In this article, we focus on the interactions between different tastants co-existing in food systems, and the recent research on odor-induced flavor enhancement. It seems that an anticipated flavor can be enhanced by the addition of a congruent aroma or taste substance (such an induced enhancement is a prominent sensory phenomenon). Hence, increasing the knowledge of the interactions among taste and odor substances will enable the development of healthy food and beverage containing multiple nutrients and bioactive substances with different taste and aroma characteristics.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of these factors in real food products. Therefore, we have investigated the impact of olfactory perception on perceived bitterness in a familiar (bitter cocoa beverage) and an unfamiliar (bitter milk) beverage. Sensory profilings with and without noseclip were conducted according to simultaneous product presentation. In a first experiment, an instant cocoa powder mixed with water was used to prepare a common base. Two types of flavourings were added: cocoa and vanilla, at three different levels (none, medium and high). Samples were compared within a flavouring type. In a second experiment a vanilla flavour was added at three levels to a milk base containing caffeine. The panellists scored bitterness, sourness, sweetness and body with noseclip. Without noseclip, overall aroma above the cup and in mouth were assessed in addition to the previous set of attributes. With noseclip, results showed that neither the cocoa nor the vanilla flavourings provided any additional taste to the beverages. Without noseclip, olfactory/taste interaction in the cocoa beverage led to an enhancement of bitterness induced by the cocoa flavouring and an increase in sweetness from the vanilla flavouring. On the contrary, in the caffeinated milk, the addition of vanilla flavouring did not significantly increase sweetness, but unexpectedly enhanced bitterness. This study is further evidence of the influence of olfaction on taste perception in complex matrices. In addition, our results suggest that taste-olfaction integration is product dependent and related to food experience, even when working with trained subjects. Furthermore, the unpleasantness due to the neophobia related to the consumption of a new product and to bitterness may enhance bitterness when the unfamiliarity of the product is increased by addition of vanilla flavouring to a bitter milk beverage. © 2006.},

Purposely, three solvents ethanol, methanol and water were utilized alongside three time intervals, i.e., 30, 60 and 90 min for the extraction of tea polyphenols. Results showed significant variations in all antioxidant indices due to both solvents and time intervals. The highest total phenolic contents ({TPC}), {DPPH}, β-carotene, theaflavin, thearubigins and catechins were detected for ethanolic solvents, whereas minimum was observed in water extract. Among the time intervals, 60 min caused maximum results followed by 90 min while minimum output was noticed at 30 min time intervals. Milk addition caused significant decline in all antioxidant indices of black tea extracts. Conclusively, extraction condition caused significant impact on tea bioactive molecules extraction and milk addition reduce the antioxidant activity of black tea. Practical Applications: Tea is second most consumed nonalcoholic beverage after water holding therapeutic potential owing to the presence of polyphenols. Optimization of different processing conditions like time and solvents should enhance the beneficial impact associated with tea. In most of countries tea is consumed with the addition of milk. The milk addition may bind the polyphenols present in tea and reduce its health benefits.

The results of the volatile compound profile analysis provided by the Agrinose device were verified with the {GC}-{MS} technique. Chemometric tests demonstrated a dominant role of alcohols, acids, aldehydes, azines, and hydrazides in the coffee volatile compound profile. The differences in their content had an impact on the odor profile of the coffees originating from the different countries. High content of pyridine from the group of azines was detected in the coffee from Peru and Brazil despite the same roasting conditions. The results of the Agrinose analysis of volatile substances were consistent and correlated with the {GC}-{MS} results.

@misc{nobleResponsesFlavourTastearoma1996,
	title = {Responses to Flavour Taste-aroma interactions},
	abstract = {Taste and aroma interactions occur each time we eat or drink. In the laboratory, smell and taste stimuli can be physically separated, whereas under normal conditions the consumption of foods and beverages results in the simultaneous perception of aroma and taste coupled with tactile sensations, all of which contribute to an overall impression of flavor. Tastes can increase the apparent intensity of aromas; conversely, the perceived intensity of tastes is increased when we taste flavored solutions, especially when there is a logical association between them, such as between sweetness and fruitiness. Recent investigations of factors that affect aroma and taste interactions are summarized in this brief review. The sensation of flavor is elicted by a combination of nasal and oral stimulation. Whether one is ingesting foods or beverages, or participating in a laboratory experiment in which odor and taste stimuli are physically separated, interactions of aroma and taste are experienced by all individuals except the anosmic, those who cannot perceive odors, or the aguesic, those who perceive no tastes. Flavor has been defined as the 'psycho-logical interpretation of a physiological response to a physical stimulus' I. The perception of flavor thus involves integration of the separate sensations of smell, taste and touch, and is influenced by their interactions. Many products, such as apples, oranges or lemons, can be recognized solely on the basis of their aroma, but on ingestion the intensity of the fruity flavor of beverages or fruit is enhanced by sweetness or sourness. Salt and monosodium glutamate are often described as flavor en-hancers because of their ability to increase the perceived intensity of beef broth or other flavors. Use of the word 'flavor' in the above examples is ambiguous: to what extent can the perception of flavor be dissected into taste and odor? Conversely, without the processing of information by the integration of these separate stimuli, how would our perception of flavor be altered? For many years, sensory scientists have investigated these interactions between taste and smell to learn more about their mechanisms and the location(s) at which the interactions are processed. Studying the nature of these interactions will aid our understanding of taste and smell perception and also of the processing of information that occurs in the brain. In this review, the interaction of taste or aroma with somatosensory stimuli is not addressed owing to space limitations; however, many odor or taste compounds also elicit pungency, cooling or heat, which also affect perception, In a psychophysical experiment, odor and taste can be physically separated or studied under controlled situations using trained judges. In contrast, normal condi-A.C. Noble is at the tions of consumption result in the integration of aroma and taste with other sensations such as pungency or chemical heat and texture, all of which contribute to an overall impression of flavor. In either situation, different types of taste-aroma interactions may occur, which are influenced by the method of stimulation, the instructions given to the judges, and the specific compounds used. Taste-aroma interactions Odor and taste interactions may result from physical, physiological, cognitive or psychological effects. The effects of non-volatile solutes and the food matrix on the concentration of aroma volatiles have been extensively studied2-5, and need to be taken into consideration in any study of the interaction of taste and aroma. Typically, salt or acid increases the headspace concentration of nonpolar volatiles\$ thus, they are expected to increase the intensity of at least selected aroma attributes solely as a function of the change in concentration of these volatiles when the volatiles are perceived by sniffing (orthonasal perception). Physical changes in the stimuli occur when a sample is ingested or masticated, which affect the rate of release and concentration of both tastants and odorants. As the matrix of the food is broken down, both are released and mixed with saliva. These perireceptor events (i.e. those occurring before interaction with taste receptors) affect partitioning, diffusion and transport of tastants in the mucosa of the oral cavity and their delivery to taste receptors. Similarly, the breakdown of the food matrix and interaction with saliva result in the release and distribution of volatiles between the oral cavity headspace and saliva. The volatiles in the headspace in the mouth can then be transferred retronasally to the olfactory receptors , through nasal passages from the back of the mouth. At the receptor level, it is extremely unlikely that taste-odor interactions occur, even in the case of a single compound that elicits taste, trigeminal and smell sensations such as menthol, which is bitter, cooling and minty. Whereas taste-taste or odor-odor interactions may occur as a result of competition at the receptor sites, bitterness is perceived at taste receptors on the tongue, cooling is perceived by the somatosensory receptors in the oral and/or nasal cavity, and mintiness is perceived retronasally at the olfactory receptors. Taste-aroma interactions more probably are a function of cognition, occurring at the central processing level. Little is known about how odor information is coded, although the influences of selective attention and learned associations have been demonstrated7. The task of processing olfactory information often involves integrating the odor with additional available information7.},

The stimuli were swallowed to augment retronasal stimulation of the olfactory system. It was found that strawberry odor tended to enhance the maximal sweetness and total rating time of the stimuli. In the second experiment, it was found that peanut butter odor did not enhance sweetness, thus demonstrating that an odor's ability to enhance sweetness is odor-dependent, In the third experiment, it was demonstrated that strawberry odor did not enhance the saltiness of sodium chloride indicating that an odor's ability to enhance taste is tastant-dependent. In the fourth experiment, it was shown that 85\% of the strawberry odorant's ability to enhance sweetness was eliminated by pinching the nostrils.

Furthermore, the antioxidant enzymatic activity and antioxidant index of polyphenols in green tea have been known to be protected through interaction with dairy proteins inside the unstable intestinal environment. In addition, consumption of green tea infused with milk has been found to have a significant impact on reducing skin wrinkles and roughness in elderly subjects, through a decrease in lipid peroxidation and a concomitant reduction in oxidative stress. A similar affinity has been observed between antioxidants in coffee and milk proteins. Dark chocolate has been known to contain significant phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The activation of protein complex {NF}-κB, which is responsible for cell survival, was found to be significantly reduced upon consumption of cocoa with water, whereas consuming cocoa with milk had no effect on the bioavailability of the phenolic compounds in cocoa.

Nontargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}) flavoromics analysis was applied to identify compounds that enhance the bitter perception of roasted coffee brew. Orthogonal partial least squares ({OPLS}) analysis was used to model the comprehensive chemical profiles and sensory bitter intensity ratings of fourteen coffee brews with good fit and predictivity. Five compounds that were highly predictive and positively correlated to bitter intensity were selected from the {OPLS} model, further isolated, and purified using preparative {LC} fractionation. Sensory recombination testing demonstrated that five compounds significantly enhanced the bitter perception of coffee when presented as a mixture, but not when presented individually. In addition, a set of roasting experiments revealed the five compounds were generated during the coffee roasting process.},

	abstract = {Change in amino acid metabolism is a trait of liver disease , and concentration decreases of the branched-chain amino acids ({BCAAs}: L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine) and/or concentration increases of aromatic amino acids ({AAAs}: phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and methionine in circulating blood are common. For the management of nutrition in hepatic encephalopathy and to prevent recurrence, it is useful to provide additional {BCAAs} and {AAAs} for the chronic hepatic failure patient. 1) These nutrients are available on the Japanese market as transfusions and nutritive drinks for parenteral and enteral nutrition, respectively. However, {BCAAs} are extremely bitter and the low palatability of nutri-tive drinks is a major problem with respect to patient compliance. 2) Table 1 shows the main amino acid concentrations of Aminoleban ® {EN}, 3) a typical nutrient product for liver failure on the Japanese market, when suspended in 50 ml of water as suggested on the package insert. The corresponding absolute thresholds of bitterness of various amino acids were derived from Yosida's article. 4) As shown in the Table 1, the concentration of {BCAAs} in Aminoleban ® {EN}, when taken according to the package insert, are 10-50-fold higher than the bitterness threshold concentrations of the {BCAAs}, suggesting that the bitterness of the product must be unpleasant for patients. 5) In the previous article, 6) we examined the bitterness intensity of Aminoleban ® {EN} and {BCAA} standard solutions of the same concentration as in Aminoleban ® {EN}, by gustatory sensation test according to the Katsuragi's paper. 7,8) The obtained bitterness for {BCAA} standard solution and Aminole-ban ® {EN} was 3.5 and 1.5, respectively. This reduction of bitterness intensity was expected to be due to the sweeteners or organic acids, such as phtalic or fumaric acids which were incorporated in the various flavored powders. Furthermore, in the previous article, we also found that the addition of some flavoured powder successfully suppressed bitterness of Aminoleban ® {EN} compared with the case of without flovoured powder even though the effect of the various aromas involved in these flavoured powders on the bitterness of {BCAAs}, the predominant bitter components of Aminoleban ® {EN}, has not yet been fully elucidated. There has been some odor-taste interaction studies. 9-12) But studies just focused on fundamental odor-taste interactions themselves, and did not focus on bitterness suppression. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the bitterness inhibitory effect of five different tasteless aromas (green-tea, coffee, vanilla, apple and strawberry) on {BCAA} solutions. Firstly, changes of the bitterness threshold of {BCAA} solutions caused by the odour of the aroma Nutritional products for patients with liver failure available on the Japanese market contain many branched-chain amino acids ({BCAAs}) such as L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-valine, which not only have a bitter taste but also strong, unpleasant odours, leading to low palatability. The palatability of these nutritional products can be significantly improved by the addition of flavoured powders containing various kinds of tastants (sucrose, citric acid, etc.) and odourants (fruit, coffee aromas, etc.). The specific effects of the aroma of flavoured powders have not yet been clearly evaluated. In the present article, the inhibitory effect of aroma on the bitterness of {BCAA} solutions was examined. The bitterness intensity of a {BCAA} solution at the same concentration as Aminoleban ® {EN} was defined as 3.5 (measured by a previously described gustatory sensation method). The bitterness threshold of a {BCAA} standard solution without added aroma was estimated to be 1.87, while those of {BCAA} solutions containing green-tea, coffee, apple, vanilla, or strawberry aromas were 2.02, 1.98, 2.35, 2.40 and 2.87, respectively, when evaluated by the probit method. This shows that the addition of an aroma can elevate the bitterness threshold in human volunteers. The green-tea and coffee aromas predominantly evoked bitterness, while the vanilla aroma predominantly evoked sweetness. Apple and strawberry aromas evoked both sweetness and sourness, with the apple aroma having stronger sourness and the strawberry aroma stronger sweetness. Thus, a 'sweet' aroma suppresses the bitterness of {BCAA}, with coexisting sourness also participating in the bitterness inhibition.

This was tested here by training participants to attend analytically or synthetically during pairing of odours with either sucrose or water. Differential conditioning effects for sucrose- and water-paired odours were seen only in the synthetic group, with sucrose-paired odours increasing in both smelled sweetness and liking.

In Experiment 1 (E1) sweetness, sourness, liking and intensity ratings were obtained for 20 odours. Taste ratings were then obtained for sucrose solutions to which the odours had been added as flavorants. Certain odours were found to enhance tasted sweetness while others suppressed it. The degree to which an odour smelled sweet was the best predictor of the taste ratings. These findings were extended in Experiment 2 (E2), which included a second tastant, citric acid, and employed four odours from E1. The most sweet smelling odour, caramel, was found to suppress the sourness of citric acid and, as in E1, to enhance the sweetness of sucrose. Again, odours with low sweetness suppressed the sweetness of tasted sucrose. The study demonstrated that the effects of odours on taste perception are not limited to sweetness enhancement and apply to sour as well as sweet tastes. The overall pattern of results is consistent with an explanation of the taste properties of odours in terms of prior flavour-taste associations.},

Data thus obtained established the presence of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, butanone, pentanone-2, and hexanone-2 in milk and cream and presented tentative evidence for heptanone-2 in cream. Quantitative analysis of these individual carbonyl compounds also was performed. The volatile compounds obtained from liquid nitrogen trapping of milk and cream were also investigated.

However, food studies involving the manipulation of product color face inevitable limitations, from extrinsic flavors introduced by food coloring to the cost in development time and resources in order to produce different product variants. One solution lies in modern virtual reality ({VR}) technology, which has become increasingly accessible, sophisticated, and widespread over the past years. In the present study, we investigated whether making a coffee look milkier in a {VR} environment can alter its perceived flavor and liking. Thirty-two United Kingdom ({UK}) consumers were given four samples of black cold brew coffee at 4 and 8\% sucrose concentration. They wore {VR} headsets throughout the study and viewed the same coffee in a virtual setting. The color of the beverage was manipulated in {VR}, such that participants saw either a dark brown or light brown liquid as they sipped the coffee. A full factorial design was used so that each participant tasted each sweetness x color combination, Participants reported sweetness, creaminess, and liking for each sample. Results revealed that beverage color as viewed in {VR} significantly influenced perceived creaminess, with the light brown coffee rated to be creamier than dark brown coffee. However, beverage color did not influence perceived sweetness or liking. The present study supports the role of {VR} as a means of conducting food perception studies, either to gain a better understanding of multisensory integration, or, from an industry perspective, to enable rapid product testing when it may be time-intensive or costly to produce the same range of products in the real-world. Furthermore, it opens potential future opportunities for {VR} to promote healthy eating behavior by manipulating the visual appearance of foods.},

	abstract = {The experiments had 2 main goals: 1) to add to the sparse literature on how retronasal aromas interact with bitter tastes, and 2) to determine whether modulation of taste intensity by aroma depends on temporal contiguity, as one might expect if flavor interactions depend on cross-modal binding (similar to object perception in other modalities). An olfactometer-gustometer allowed independent oral presentation of odorized air and liquid samples. First, using simultaneous presentation of odors and tastes (Experiments 1a-d) we found that a "sweet-smelling" aroma enhanced the rated sweetness of sucrose and decreased the rated bitterness of sucrose octaacetate ({SOA}), and that a "bitter-smelling" aroma enhanced the bitterness of {SOA} and decreased the sweetness of sucrose. Thus, with respect to effects on taste intensity, sweet and bitter aromas mimicked mixture-interactions between sweet and bitter tastes under current conditions. Next (Experiment 2), both odors were again paired with both tastes, with a parametric manipulation of odor onset. Odor presentation ranged from before taste delivery to after taste delivery. Enhancement of taste intensity was greatest with simultaneous onset, and greatly attenuated with offsets of 1 s. These results are consistent with the idea that enhancement of taste by retronasal aroma depends on a temporal binding window like many other cross-modal interactions. The effects of temporal offsets on suppression of taste were inconclusive. These findings are discussed within the context of past work on odor-taste interactions.},

The primary goal of this study was to determine whether asymmetries in suppression between stimuli in binary mixtures predict the perception of tastes in more complex mixtures (e.g., ternary and quaternary mixtures). Also of interest was the longstanding question of whether overall taste intensity derives from the sum of the tastes perceived within a mixture (perceptual additivity) or from the sum of the perceived intensities of the individual stimuli (stimulus additivity). Using the general labeled magnitude scale together with a sip-and-spit procedure, we asked subjects to rate overall taste intensity and the sweetness, sourness, saltiness and bitterness of approximately equi-intense sucrose, {NaCl}, citric acid and {QSO}4 stimuli presented alone and in all possible binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures. The results showed a consistent pattern of mixture suppression in which sucrose sweetness tended to be both the least suppressed quality and the strongest suppressor of other tastes. The overall intensity of mixtures was found to be predicted best by perceptual additivity. A second experiment that was designed to rule out potentially confounding effects of the order of taste ratings and the temperature of taste solutions replicated the main findings of the first experiment. Overall, the results imply that mixture suppression favors perception of sweet carbohydrates in foods at the expense of other potentially harmful ingredients, such as high levels of sodium (saltiness) and potential poisons or spoilage (bitterness and sourness). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

To address these questions, we presented food odorants (chicken, orange, and 3 mixtures of the 2) and tastants (savory-salty and sour-sweet) in pairs varying in congruence. Participants were to report the perceived congruence of the pairs along with intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity. We found that participants could perceive distinct congruence levels, thereby favoring a multilevel account of congruence perception. In addition, familiarity and pleasantness followed the same pattern as the congruence while intensity was highest for the most congruent and the most incongruent pairs whereas intensities of the intermediary-congruent pairs were reduced. Principal component analysis revealed that pleasantness and familiarity form one dimension of the phenomenological experience of odor-taste pairs that was orthogonal to intensity.

	abstract = {Introduction: There is a continued need for the application of flavour modifiers to improve the sensory profile of products within the functional food market. Additionally, psychophysical studies have tended to confine their scope to stimuli that elicit single sensations, and ingredients that are not always of most interest to the food industry. While basic taste-eliciting compounds and odourants have been used in functional food optimisation, modification can also include the addition of bitter-blocking ingredients. This study examines the impact that these modifiers have both alone and in conjunction with each other on the flavour of (+)-catechin containing model functional beverages. Methods: The intensities of sweetness, bitterness, astringency and aroma were rated for (+)-catechin ({CAT}) aqueous solutions alone and containing a sweetener [sucrose or rebaudioside A ({REB})], an odourant (vanilla or black tea), a bitter blocker [ß-cyclodextrin ({CD}) or homoeriodictyol sodium salt], and all combinations of each. Results: The use of sweeteners, both alone and in conjunction with bitter blockers, decreased the bitterness of {CAT}, while odourants had no effect. {CD} + {REB} significantly decreased the astringency of {CAT}. Astringency and bitterness of {CAT} was not altered by the addition of bitter blockers alone or in combination with odourants. Bitter blockers did not affect intensities of sweetness and aroma. Conclusions: The use of sweeteners in combination with bitter blockers can lower the bitterness of (+)-catechin. The addition of bitter blockers may be used without a detrimental effect on the flavour profile of model beverages. Implications: Decreasing the bitterness of plant-derived, health-promoting compounds may be achieved through the application of certain sweet eliciting and bitter-blocking compounds, which in turn, may lead to increasing the acceptability of some functional foods for bitter sensitive consumer populations.},

	abstract = {While flavours comprised of simple taste/odour combinations can be easily decomposed, there is evidence that the individual components are seldom perceived independently. Manifestations of interactions include smell/taste confusions, attribution of taste properties such as sweetness or sourness to odours, and the enhancement and suppression of tastes by such odours. These phenomena are probably the result of blurring of the perceptual boundaries of odour and taste properties during repeated pairings as flavours. Following such pairings in the laboratory, odours can be shown to increase in perceived taste properties. It is proposed that during flavour formation, the components are encoded in memory in such a way that a later odour stimulus also elicits taste properties. Sensory properties such as sweetness can thus be seen as cognitive phenomena associated with both tastes and odours, in the latter case residing in memory. However, unlike some odour combinations, flavours, although usually perceived as a functional whole, are not indivisible synthetic entities. Perceptual interactions between odours and tastes are dependent on the extent to which an analytical approach is taken to the measurement of flavour qualities. Thus, odour enhancement of sucrose sweetness is not observed when the intensities of all the components in a flavour are rated. This has been interpreted as a consequence of rating strategies. However, the data are more consistent with a perceptual/cognitive interpretation. Recent research from our lab has shown that the cognitive strategy employed during the pairing of odours and tastes will also determine whether taste/odour interactions occur. The question of how to measure flavour properties is raised by these findings. Whether panellists focus on the sensory source of, for example, sweetness will depend upon the perceptual strategy they adopt. Asking panellists to focus only on the taste sweetness, while possible, may be assuming that odour and taste properties are independent within foods ©.},

The increased sweetness of the target odor was unaffected by whether or not subjects revealed some explicit knowledge of the contingencies in a post-conditioning recognition test. Experiment 2 found that such a conditioned increase in odor sweetness occurred whether training solutions were sipped from a cup or sucked through a straw. Using a frequency test designed to provide a sensitive assay of contingency awareness, there was still no indication that this affected conditioning.

In the present work we aimed at studying relations between food texture and food odor, using both psychophysical and imaging techniques. Eighteen right-handed healthy human subjects participated to both behavioral and {fMRI} sessions. Fresh, sweetened milk and a more thickened version were delivered orally; in addition, a buttery-cream aroma was presented ortho- or retronasally. Stimuli were applied using a gustometer and or an air-dilution olfactometer, both computer-controlled. In each session subjects rated separately odor-, taste- and thickness intensities of the stimuli. The behavioral data show that odors, presented through either retro- or orthonasal path, induce a significant flavor enhancement with respect to the no-odor condition. Brain functional data indicated a significant enhancement of the activation of olfactory eloquent areas in favor of ortho-nasal odor presentation while activations of mechanosensory areas were favored by the retro-nasal odor route. As effect of oral stimuli we found a significant correlation between the texture intensity rating vs. the {BOLD} signal in the supplementary motor area, known to drive subconsciously primed movement, putatively associated in this case with the tongue movement required with the handling of the stimulus. Moreover, we found inhibition of the signal in different sensory specific areas as an effect of the mutual interaction between stimulus qualities. In conclusion, ortho- and retronasal odors differentially affect the neural processing of the texture of oral stimuli.},

	abstract = {{MURPHY}, C. {AND} W. S. {CAIN}. Taste and olfaction: Independence vs interaction. {PHYSIOL}. {BEHAV}. 24(3) 601-605, 1980.-Twenty persons sipped and judged overall perceived magnitude, odor magnitude, and taste magnitude of various concentrations of the odorant citral, the tastants sodium chloride and sucrose, and odorant-tastant combinations. In a second experiment, the same twenty persons sniffed and judged perceived odor magnitude for the same set of stimuli. The investigation probed two primary questions: Does the apparent harmony of an olfactory-taste mixture dictate the degree of additivity in that mixture? Does harmony of the components influence the production of any taste-smell confusion? The data from both the harmonious mixture (citral and sucrose) and the dissonant mixture (citral and {NaCI}) imply absence of sensory inhibition or facilitation between taste and olfaction. Nevertheless, both types of mixtures led to substantial taste-{smeU} confusion whereby olfactory stimulation evoked sensations of taste. Taste Olfaction Additivity {PREVIOUS} research demonstrated that when stimulated with an odor-taste mixture the olfactory and taste systems behaved in an approximately additive manner, that is, approximately independently [6]. Despite this apparent independence of functioning, persons often confused the locus of stimulation. They perceived olfactory stimulation as taste, a mislocalization long known but rarely explored [3]. The present investigation probes the phenomena of additivity and mislocalization further. The primary question concerns whether the harmony of an odor-taste mixture determines the degree of additivity. Citral (an odorant with both a sweet and a lemon smell) and sucrose served here as the harmonious mixture, and citral and sodium chloride as the dissonant mixture. In our culture, fruit beverages flavored with sucrose are familiar, congruous, common. Fruit beverages flavored with sodium chloride are unfamiliar, incongruous, the exception. Sucrose and {NaCl} were chosen both for their relationships to citral and for their prototypical appeal only to taste and not to olfaction. {METHOD} Experiment 1 Subjects. Fourteen women and six men served. All but one had previous experience in psychophysical experiments. Stimuli. The stimuli were three concentrations each of citral, sucrose, sodium chloride, all nine possible mixtures of citral and sucrose, all nine possible mixtures of citral and sodium chloride, and deionized water alone. There were therefore 28 stimuli. Citral, a lipid soluble odorant, was first dissolved in ethyl alcohol in the proportions 1 to 20. The resulting solution, soluble in water, permitted preparation of aqueous concentrations of 0.001, 0.003, and 0.006\% citral. The accompanying small amounts of the relatively ineffective odorant ethyl alcohol (0.019, 0.057, and 0.114\% respectively) present only to facilitate the water solubility of citral, were well below thresholds for taste or for trigeminal sensation and produced no discernible sensory impact [5, 10, 11]. Concentrations of sucrose and {NaCl} were 0.04, 0.12, and 0.36 M. The stimuli were presented at room temperature in disposable polyethylene cups. Gas-chromatography (flame ionization detector) revealed a proportionality between nominal and vapor-phase concentration of citral over the range employed, 0.001\% to 0.006\% (see [1] for a description of the vessels used to assess vapor-phase concentration). The addition of sucrose or sodium chloride to the solutions of citral caused no systematic change in vapor-phase concentration. Hence, the odorant neither gained nor lost potency when mixed with the in-volatile taste stimuli. Procedure. Each subject participated in six 1.0-1.5 hr sessions. The subjects assessed perceived intensity by means of magnitude estimation with no prescribed modulus [8]. That is, they assigned numbers proportional to perceived intensity with no constraints on the number chosen first. Upon presentation of each sample, the subject rinsed with deionized water, expectorated, sipped approximately 10 ml of the stimulus, expectorated, and recorded a response.},

Interactions between stimuli with different taste qualities. {PHYSIOL}. {BEHAV}. {lO}(6) 1101-1106, 1973.-Adaptation effects were exammed between all possible palrs of the following substances: water, {NaCl}, urea, citric acid, caffeine, and sucrose. Each substance was used both as an adapting solution and as a test stimulus. Adaptation to a stimulus of one quality affects the taste of other stimuli through the addition of a water taste to the usual taste of the second stimulus, rather than by enhancement of the response to the second stimulus, per se, as had previously been thought. That {IS}, water becomes a taste stimulus when it is presented followmg various adaptation conditions. The taste of the water solvent in the second stimulus adds to the normal taste of the solute in that stimulus No evidence was found for true interactions among different taste qualities. Adaptation effects Taste qualities {STUDIES} of gustatory adaptation can be divided into two general categories: those in which the adapting and test stimuli have the same taste quahty and those in which the qualities are different. Interest in the latter arose initially from a turn-of-thecentury controversy over whether different taste qualities were sufficiently distinct to constitute different sensory modalities. bhrwall [23] argued that the basic tastes were as different from each other as they were from, say, colors or sounds. Kiesow, however, performed epperiments showing interactions among the taste qualities that included the enhancement of one quality by prior exposure of the tongue to a stimulus having a different quality. Kiesow reported finding this cross enhancement (he called it successive contrast) among all pairs of the four basic taste qualities [ 12,131. Subsequent studies [ 10, 15, 2 1 I have supported the existence of cross-enhancement, with one exception; Hahn and Ulbrich 1111 found no changes in thresholds after adapting to substances with qualities different from that of the test solution. Their procedure deserves special attention because it differs considerably from conventional procedures. In order to prevent recovery from adaptation during the measurement of threshold, they mixed the substance to be tested in the adapting solution instead of water. This procedure inadvertently prevented the occurrence of the water taste, a phenomenon that was not understood at that time. We now know that water becomes a taste stimulus when it is presented following adaptation to many sapid substances. Bartoshuk, {McBurney} and Pfaffmann [5] found that adapting to weak {NaCl} caused water to have a sour-bitter taste. The concentration of sodium m that experiment was in the range of normal mixed saliva, implying that the tastes often attributed to distilled water are due to sodium chloride adaptation. Since then it has been shown that all four basic tastes can be produced in water by suitable adaptation [ 2, 16, 191. It has also been shown that the water taste of a compound will add to the taste of a weak solution that follows it [9,161. The water taste phenomenon suggests a reinterpretation of those studies that found cross-enhancement. The enhancement may have been produced by the water in which the second stimulus was dissolved rather than by the solute itself. Of the earlier studies, only Hahn and Ulbrich controlled for the water taste and only they failed to find cross-enhancement.},

	abstract = {Observers are often asked to make intensity judgments for a sensory attribute of a stimulus that is embedded in a background of "irrelevant" stimulus dimensions. Under some circumstances, these background dimensions of the stimulus can influence intensity judgments for the target attribute. For example, judgments of sweetness can be influenced by the other taste or odor qualities of a solution (Frank \& Byram, 1988; Kamen et al., 1961). Experiments 1 and 2 assessed the influence of stimulus context, instructional set, and reference stimuli on cross-quality interactions in mixtures of chemosensory stimuli. Experiment 1 demonstrated that odor-induced changes in sweetness judgments were dramatically influenced when subjects rated multiple attributes of the stimulus as compared with when they judged sweetness alone. Several odorants enhanced sweetness when sweetness alone was judged, while sweetness was suppressed for these same stimuli when total-intensity ratings were broken down into ratings for the sweetness, salt-iness, sourness, bitterness, and fruitiness of each solution. Experiment 2 demonstrated a similar pattern of results when bitterness was the target taste. In addition, Experiment 2 showed that the instructional effects applied to both taste-odor and taste-taste mixtures. It was concluded that the taste enhancement and suppression observed for taste-odor and taste-taste mixtures are influenced by (1) instructional sets which influence subjects' concepts of attribute categories, and (2) the perceptual similarities among the quality dimensions of the stimulus. Many psychophysical experiments involve observers making judgments about the intensitive dimensions of a stimulus. These judgments are often made for stimuli which produce a complex pattern of sensory activation both within and across various sensory modalities. As a result, the experiences associated with these stimuli are usually multidimensional. Obviously, a request that an observer rate the intensity of such a complex stimulus can be ambiguous. For example, most foods and beverages consist of a multitude of chemical substances which are capable of stimulating olfactory, gustatory, tactile, temperature , and nociceptive receptors. An observer could rate the intensity of the taste, smell, "feel," or "tingle" associated with the stimulus, or could rate the intensity of different qualities within one modality (for example, sweet, salty, sour, or bitter for taste). possible for an observer to make estimates of the overall strength of the stimulus by integrating the component dimensions. Depending on the hypotheses under investigation , one or another of these approaches to assessing stimulus intensity should be employed. Sometimes the re-searcher's primary interest may be the total intensity of a stimulus, whereas at other times the research questions focus on the intensity of a particular stimulus component. To use an analogy from the concert hall, sometimes a conductor is concerned with the overall loudness of the entire orchestra whereas at other times the relative loudness of a particular instrumental section is of greater concern. It seems likely that the principles that govern the integration of multiple stimulus dimensions into a single intensity estimate are different from those which govern intensity ratings for a single stimulus attribute in the face of a complex, multidimensional background. Anderson (1981) has studied the processes of integration using information-integration theory and functional measurement. Information-integration experiments typically attempt to discover how two or more independent variables combine to jointly influence a response along a common dimension. For example, the contribution of multiple taste qualities to total taste intensity has been studied by several investigators using the information-integration approach (Frank \& Archambo, 1986; Schifferstein \& Frij-ters, 1990). Other experiments have focused on judgments 343},

	abstract = {The Labeled Magnitude Scale ({LMS}) is a semantic scale of perceptual intensity characterized by a quasi-logarithmic spacing of its verbal labels. The {LMS} had previously been shown to yield psychophysical functions equivalent to magnitude estimation ({ME}) when gustatory, thermal and nociceptive stimuli were presented and rated together, and the upper bound of the {LMS} was defined as the 'strongest imaginable oral sensation'. The present study compared the {LMS} to {ME} within the more limited contexts of taste and smell. In Experiment 1, subjects used both methods to rate either taste intensity produced by sucrose and {NaCI} or odor intensity produced by acetic acid and phenyl ethyl alcohol, with the upper bound of the {LMS} defined as either the 'strongest imaginable taste' or the 'strongest imaginable odor'. The {LMS} produced psychophysical functions equivalent to those produced by {ME}. In Experiment 2 a new group of subjects used both methods to rate the intensity of three different taste qualities, with the upper bound of the {LMS} defined as the 'strongest imaginable [sweetness, saltiness, or bitterness]'. In all three cases the {LMS} produced steeper functions than did {ME}. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that the {LMS} yields data comparable to {ME} only when the perceptual domain under study includes painful sensations. This hypothesis was supported when the {LMS} again produced steeper functions than {ME} after subjects had been explicitly instructed to omit painful sensations (e.g. the 'burn' of hot peppers) from the concept of 'strongest imaginable taste'. We conclude that the {LMS} can be used to scale sensations of taste and smell when they are broadly defined, but that it should be modified for use in scaling specific taste (and probably odor) qualities. The implications of these results for theoretical issues related to {ME}, category-ratio scales and the size of the perceptual range in different sensory modalities are discussed.},

	abstract = {Tea and coffee are widely consumed beverages across the world and they are rich sources of various polyphenols. Polyphenols are responsible for the bitterness and astringency of beverages and are also well known to impart antioxidant properties which is beneficial against several oxidative stress related diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. On the other hand, proteins are also known to display many important roles in several physiological activities. Polyphenols can interact with proteins through hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions, leading to the formation of soluble or insoluble complexes. According to recent studies, this complex formation can affect the bioavailability and beneficiary properties of both the individual components, in either way. For example, polyphenol-protein complex formation can reduce or enhance the antioxidant activity of polyphenols; similarly it can also affect the digestion ability of several digestive enzymes present in our body. Surprisingly, no review article has been published recently which has focused on the progress in this area, despite numerous articles having appeared in this field. This review summarizes the recent trends and patterns (2005 onwards) in polyphenol-protein interaction studies focusing on the characterization of the complex, the effect of this complex formation on tea and coffee taste, antioxidant properties and the digestive system. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.},

@misc{gillanMixtureSuppressionEffect1982,
	title = {Mixture suppression: The effect of spatial separation between sucrose and {NaCI}},
	abstract = {Four experiments investigated the mechanisms of taste mixture suppression, the decrease in perceived intensity of a taste stimulus in a mixture in comparison with the taste presented by itself. Temporally simultaneous, spatially intermixed taste stimuli (sucrose and {NaCl}) showed substantial mixture suppression, whereas temporally simultaneous, spatially separated stimuli showed only slight suppression (Experiments {lA} and {IB}). The perceived intensity of simultaneously presented taste stimuli was inversely related to the distance between the stimuli (Experiment 2). The sensitivity of mixture suppression to a peripheral manipulation, the spatial relation of the stimuli on the tongue, suggests that the primary mechanism for sucrose-{NaCI} mixture suppression is a peripheral one. Experiment 3 demonstrated that mixture suppression was sensitive to a manipulation of the sensory system-adaptation. Adapting one component of a mixture, then presenting the mixture, resulted in little suppression of the unadapted component of the mixture. The sensitivity of mixture suppression to a manipulation of the taste system suggests that an important mechanism for sucrose-{NaCI} mixture suppression is located in the sensory system. Specific peripheral-sensory theories of mixture suppression are discussed. Subjects often judge a given concentration of a taste stimulus to be less intense when it is presented with another taste stimulus than when it is presented alone (Bartoshuk, (1975) subjects rated .36 M {NaCI} to have a perceived saltiness of 19.1 and .36 M sucrose to have a perceived sweetness of 21.8, but a mixture of .36 M {NaCI} plus .36 M sucrose to have a perceived salti-ness and sweetness of9.3 and 15.8, respectively. This reduction of perceived intensity of a taste stimulus in a mixture is known as mixture suppression. There are many possible theoretical accounts of mixture suppression. These theories can be classified according to the location of their proposed mechanism in the taste system: (1) presensory theories, (2) peripheral-sensory theories, and (3) central theories. Presensory theories propose that the mechanism for mixture suppression is located outside the taste system. For example, one theory in this class might suggest that two chemical taste stimuli interact in solution prior to contact with the taste receptor (see Lawless, 1979, for examples). Such a chemical interaction might reduce the number of taste molecules This research was supported by the General Foods Technical Center. The author thanks Joan Stark for help in these experiments and Harry Lawless for discussions about mixture suppression. Requests for reprints should be sent to the author at General Foods Technical Center, T23-1, {SSS} South Broadway, Tarrytown, New York {IOS}91. available for contact with a receptor and in that way suppress the perceived intensity of that stimulus. The second class of theories, peripheral-sensory theories, proposes that the mechanism for mixture suppression is located at a peripheral level of the taste system, that is, after both taste stimuli have contacted the receptors, but prior to processing of the sensory information at a central level in the sensory system. An example theory in this class suggests spatial inhibition as a mechanism for mixture suppression (e.g., Bartoshuk, 1975; Lawless, 1979). According to a spatial inhibition theory, taste channels for different of different qualities, for example, sucrose (sweet) and {NaCI} (salty), have localized in-hibitory interactions with each other (see Marks, 1974, for a review of spatial inhibition). As a consequence of these inhibitory interactions, stimulation of the sucrose channel will reduce any concurrent stimulation of a nearby {NaCI} channel, and vice versa. The third class of theories, central theories, proposes that the mechanism for mixture suppression is located centrally in the sensory system, at a relatively high level of taste information processing. An example theory from this class would involve selective attention as the mechanism for mixture suppression. A selective attention theory would hypothesize that a subject has a limited processing capacity and can fully process or attend to a single stimulus, but must distribute those limited processing resources across multiple, concurrent stimuli. Thus, sucrose alone or {NaCI} alone would receive all of the processing, but they would have to share or compete for access to the limited processor when presented},

Beverage formulations were based on a complete balanced 3-factor (fat, true protein, and casein as a percentage of true protein) design with 3 fat levels (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0\%), 4 true protein ({TP}) levels (3.00, 3.67, 4.34, and 5.00\%) within each fat level, and 5 casein as a percentage of true protein ({CN}\%{TP}) levels (5, 25, 50, 75, and 80\%) within each protein level (for a total of 60 formulations within each of 2 replicates). Instrumental measures of Hunter L and a values and Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage ({CIE}) b* values, instrumental viscosity, particle size, flavor, sensory texture and sensory appearance evaluations were done on each pasteurized/homogenized beverage formulation. Within each of the 3 fat levels, higher serum protein concentration drove higher aroma intensity, sweet aromatic, cooked/sulfur, cardboard/doughy flavors, and sensory yellowness scores, whereas higher casein concentration drove higher instrumental viscosity in milk protein beverages. Increasing serum protein concentration increased yellowness, sweet aromatic, aroma intensity, cooked/sulfur, and cardboard/doughy flavors across all fat levels and also had the largest effect on L, a, and b* values, sensory whiteness, and opacity within each fat level. Increases in true protein increased throat cling and astringency intensities. Increases in fat concentration were correlated with higher L, a, and b* values, larger particle size, and increased sensory whiteness, mouth coating, cooked/milky, and milkfat flavors. Multiple linear regression of L, a, and b* values produced better predictions of sensory whiteness and yellowness of pasteurized milk protein beverages than simple linear regression of L or b* values, respectively. Formulating milk protein beverages to a higher true protein level increased astringency regardless of fat level. When formulating milk protein beverages, a product developer has a wide range of milk-based protein ingredient choices that differ in price and change price relationship across time. Understanding the expected relative effect of different milk protein ingredients on the textural and flavor characteristics of milk-based beverages could be used to help guide product reformulation decisions and ingredient choices to achieve a specific sensory profile while controlling total beverage ingredient cost.},

	abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease influenced by environmental factors. Objectives: The feasibility of a multimodal intervention and its effect on perceived fatigue in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were assessed. Design/setting: This was a single-arm, open-label intervention study in an outpatient setting. Interventions: A multimodal intervention including a modified paleolithic diet with supplements, stretching, strengthening exercises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage was used. Outcome measures: Adherence to each component of the intervention was calculated using daily logs. Side-effects were assessed from a monthly questionnaire and blood analyses. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale ({FSS}). Data were collected at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Results: Ten (10) of 13 subjects who were enrolled in a 2-week run-in phase were eligible to continue in the 12-month main study. Of those 10 subjects, 8 completed the study and 6 subjects fully adhered to the study intervention for 12 months. Over a 12-month period, average adherence to diet exceeded 90\% of days, and to exercise/muscle stimulation exceeded 75\% of days. Nutritional supplements intake varied among and within subjects. Group daily average duration of meditation was 13.3 minutes and of massage was 7.2 minutes. No adverse side-effects were reported. Group average {FSS} scores decreased from 5.7 at baseline to 3.32 (p=0.0008) at 12 months. Conclusions: In this small, uncontrolled pilot study, there was a significant improvement in fatigue in those who completed the study. Given the small sample size and completer rate, further evaluation of this multimodal therapy is warranted. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Crohn's disease ({CD}) is characterized by chronic and relapsing inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract. It is assumed that oxidative stress contributes to {CD} pathogenesis, but systemic biomarkers for oxidative stress in {CD} are not yet identified. A reduction in free thiol groups in plasma proteins ("plasma free thiols") reflects systemic oxidative stress since they are prime substrates for reactive oxygen species. Here, we determined the concentrations of plasma free thiols in {CD} patients and healthy controls and studied the putative correlation with disease parameters. Methods: Free thiols were quantified in plasma of patients with {CD} in clinical remission [according to the Harvey Bradshaw Index ({HBI})] and healthy controls and adjusted for plasma albumin. Albumin-adjusted free thiol concentrations were analyzed for associations with clinical and biochemical disease markers. Results: Mean plasma free thiol concentrations were significantly lower in patients with {CD} (n = 51) compared to healthy controls (n = 27) (14.7 ± 2.4 vs. 17.9 ± 1.8 μmol/g albumin; P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with {CD} with above-average free thiols had significantly lower {CRP} levels (median 1.4 [interquartile range] [0.4; 2.6] vs. 3.6 [0.6; 7.0] mg/L; P {\textless} 0.05) and {BMI} (23.6 ± 4.8 vs. 27.1 ± 5.2 kg/m2; P {\textless} 0.05). Patients with {CD} having solely colonic disease demonstrated markedly reduced plasma free thiol concentrations compared to patients with ileocolonic involvement (13.2 ± 1.8 vs. 15.2 ± 2.2 μmol/g; P {\textless} 0.05). Finally, plasma free thiol concentrations negatively correlated with biomarkers of inflammation, including {hsCRP}, {SAA}, {IL}-17A (all P {\textless} 0.05), and {VEGF}. Conclusion: Plasma free thiols are reduced in patients with {CD} in clinical remission compared to healthy controls. Thus, subclinical {CD} disease activity is reflected by systemic oxidative stress and plasma free thiols may be a relevant therapeutic target and biomarker to monitor disease activity in {CD}.},

	abstract = {Oxygen free radical and lipid peroxides (oxidative stress) are highly reactive and represent very damaging compounds. Oxidative stress could be a major contributing factor to the tissue injury and fibrosis that characterize Crohn's disease. An imbalance between increased reactive oxygen species levels and decreased antioxidant defenses occurs in Crohn's patients. Decreased blood levels of vitamins C and E and decreased intestinal mucosal levels of {CuZn} superoxide dismutase, glutathione, vitamin A, C, E, and β-carotene have been reported for Crohn's patients. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and -8 and tumor necrosis factor, have been detected in inflammatory bowel disease. Oxidative stress significantly increased the production of neutrophils, chemokines, and interleukin-8. These effects were inhibited by antioxidant vitamins and arachidonic acid metabolite inhibitors in human intestinal smooth muscle cells isolated from the bowels of Crohn's disease patients. The main pathological feature of Crohn's disease is an infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear cells into the affected part of the intestine. Activated neutrophils produce noxious substances that cause inflammation and tissue injury. Due to the physiological and biochemical actions of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides, many of the clinical and pathophysiological features of Crohn's disease might be explained by an imbalance of increased reactive oxygen species and a net decrease of antioxidant molecules. This review describes the general concepts of free radical, lipid peroxide and antioxidant activities and eventually illustrates their interferences in the development of Crohn's strictures. © 2013 Baishideng.

	abstract = {Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut, but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Perceptions of the flavors of foods or beverages reflect information derived from multiple sensory afferents, including gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory fibers. Although flavor perception therefore arises from the central integration of multiple sensory inputs, it is possible to distinguish the different modalities contributing to flavor, especially when attention is drawn to particular sensory characteristics. Nevertheless, our experiences of the flavor of a food or beverage are also simultaneously of an overall unitary perception. Research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind this integrated flavor perception is, for the most part, relatively recent. However, psychophysical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies on cross-modal sensory interactions involved in flavor perception have started to provide an understanding of the integrated activity of sensory systems that generate such unitary perceptions, and hence the mechanisms by which these signals are "functionally united when anatomically separated". Here we review this recent research on odor/taste integration, and propose a model of flavor processing that depends on prior experience with the particular combination of sensory inputs, temporal and spatial concurrence, and attentional allocation. We propose that flavor perception depends upon neural processes occurring in chemosensory regions of the brain, including the anterior insula, frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as upon the interaction of this chemosensory "flavor network" with other heteromodal regions including the posterior parietal cortex and possibly the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

During this process, lymph flows through several lymph nodes, allowing antigens to be sampled by the immune system. Abnormalities in lymphatic drainage have been noted in the original descriptions of Crohn's disease, but essentially ignored since. The lymphatic system is re-emerging as a critical player in inflammatory and immune processes and the purpose of this review is to present and discuss new concepts related to the involvement of the lymphatic system in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases ({IBDs}) and more specifically Crohn's disease. {RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Recent studies reporting lymphangitis, lymphangiogenesis, bacterial infiltration and lymph node infection, immune cell trafficking, and fat-wrapping in Crohn's disease suggest altered lymph drainage and lymphatic pumping, implicating the lymphatic system as a likely player in inflammatory disorders and {IBDs}. {SUMMARY}: Improved knowledge and appreciation of the roles that the lymphatic system plays in immune cell trafficking, infection, fat transport, distribution and metabolism and, of course, edema resolution is necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease and may provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies. © 2011 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) is a result of a complex interplay between genes, host immune response, gut microbiota, and environmental factors. As one of the crucial environmental factors, diet plays a pivotal role in the modulation of gut microbiota community and the development of {IBD}. In this review, we present an overview of dietary patterns involved in the pathogenesis and management of {IBD}, and analyze the associated gut microbial alterations. A Westernized diet rich in protein, fats and refined carbohydrates tends to cause dysbiosis and promote {IBD} progression. Some dietary patterns have been found effective in obtaining {IBD} clinical remission, including Crohn’s Disease Exclusion Diet ({CDED}), Mediterranean diet ({MD}), Anti-Inflammatory Diet ({AID}), the low-“Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides and Polyols” ({FODMAP}) diet, Specific Carbohydrate Diet ({SCD}), and plant-based diet, etc. Overall, many researchers have reported the role of diet in regulating gut microbiota and the {IBD} disease course. However, more prospective studies are required to achieve consistent and solid conclusions in the future. This review provides some recommendations for studies exploring novel and potential dietary strategies that prevent {IBD}.},

While the P53 diet worsened the {DSS}-induced inflammation both in intensity and duration, the P30 diet, when compared to the P14 diet, showed a beneficial effect during the epithelial repair process by accelerating inflammation resolution, reducing colonic permeability and increasing epithelial repair together with epithelial hyperproliferation. Dietary protein intake also impacted mucosa-adherent microbiota composition after inflammation since P30 fed mice showed increased colonization of butyrate-producing genera throughout the resolution phase. This study revealed that in our colitis model, the amount of protein in the diet modulated mucosal healing, with beneficial effects of a moderately high-protein diet, while very high-protein diet displayed deleterious effects on this process.},

Methods: Eligible patients with active {CD} (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [{PCDAI}]≥ 15) underwent a patency capsule and, if passed intact, capsule endoscopy ({CE}) was performed. Patients taking {SCD} were monitored for 52 weeks while maintaining all prescribed medications. Demographic, dietary, and clinical information, {PCDAI}, Harvey-Bradshaw Index ({HBI}), and Lewis score ({LS}) were collected at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. {CEs} were evaluated by an experienced reader blinded to patient clinical information and timing. Results: Sixteen patients were screened; 10 enrolled; and 9 completed the initial 12-week trial-receiving 85\% of estimated caloric needs before, and 101\% on the {SCD}. {HB} significantly decreased from 3.3± 2.0 to 0.6± 1.3 (P=0.007) as did {PCDAI} (21.1± 5.9 to 7.8± 7.1, P=0.011). {LS} declined significantly from 2153± 732 to 960± 433 (P=0.012). Seven patients continued the {SCD} up to 52 weeks; {HB} (0.1 ± 0.4) and {PCDAI} (5.4 ± 5.5) remained improved (P = 0.016 and 0.027 compared to baseline), with mean {LS} at 1046 ± 372 and 2 patients showed sustained mucosal healing. Conclusions: Clinical and mucosal improvements were seen in children with {CD}, who used {SCD} for 12 and 52 weeks. In addition, {CE} can monitor mucosal improvement in treatment trials for pediatric {CD}. Further studies are critically needed to understand the mechanisms underlying {SCD}'s effectiveness in children with {CD}.},

	abstract = {Diet is a key environmental factor in inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) and, at the same time, represents one of the most promising therapies for {IBD}. Our daily diet often contains food additives present in numerous processed foods and even in dietary supplements. Recently, re-searchers and national authorities have been paying much attention to their toxicity and effects on gut microbiota and health. This review aims to gather the latest data focusing on the potential role of food additives in the pathogenesis of {IBDs} through gut microbiota modulation. Some artificial emulsifiers and sweeteners can induce the dysbiosis associated with an alteration of the intestinal barrier, an activation of chronic inflammation, and abnormal immune response accelerating the onset of {IBD}. Even if most of these results are retrieved from in vivo and in vitro studies, many artificial food additives can represent a potential hidden driver of gut chronic inflammation through gut microbiota alterations, especially in a population with {IBD} predisposition. In this context, pending the confirmation of these results by large human studies, it would be advisable that {IBD} patients avoid the consumption of processed food containing artificial food additives and follow a personalized nutritional therapy prescribed by a clinical nutritionist.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases ({IBDs}) develop in genetically predisposed individuals in response to environmental factors. {IBDs} are concomitant conditions of industrialized societies, and diet is a potential culprit. Consumption of ultra-processed food has increased over the last decade in industrialized countries, and epidemiological studies have found associations between ultra-processed food consumption and chronic diseases. Further studies are now required to identify the potential culprit in ultra-processed food, such as a poor nutritional composition or the presence of food additives. In our review, we will focus on food additives, i.e., substances from packaging in contact with food, and compounds formed during production, processing, and storage. A literature search using {PubMed} from inception to January 2019 was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or food additive and their role in {IBDs}. Manuscripts published in English from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. We found numerous experimental studies highlighting the key role of food additives in {IBD} exacerbation but epidemiological studies on food additives on {IBD} risk are still limited. As diet is a modifiable environmental risk factor, this may offer a scientific rationale for providing dietary advice for {IBD} patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Crohn’s disease ({CD}) is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Diet modulates the intestinal microbiome and therefore has a therapeutic potential. The aim of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of three versions of the specific carbohydrate diet ({SCD}) in active Crohn’s Disease. Methods: 18 patients with mild/moderate {CD} ({PCDAI} 15–45) aged 7 to 18 years were enrolled. Patients were randomized to either {SCD}, modified {SCD}({MSCD}) or whole foods ({WF}) diet. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. {PCDAI}, inflammatory labs and multi-omics evaluations were assessed. Results: Mean age was 14.3 ± 2.9 years. At week 12, all participants (n = 10) who completed the study achieved clinical remission. The C-reactive protein decreased from 1.3 ± 0.7 at enrollment to 0.9 ± 0.5 at 12 weeks in the {SCD} group. In the {MSCD} group, the {CRP} decreased from 1.6 ± 1.1 at enrollment to 0.7 ± 0.1 at 12 weeks. In the {WF} group, the {CRP} decreased from 3.9 ± 4.3 at enrollment to 1.6 ± 1.3 at 12 weeks. In addition, the microbiome composition shifted in all patients across the study period. While the nature of the changes was largely patient specific, the predicted metabolic mode of the organisms increasing and decreasing in activity was consistent across patients. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of diet in {CD}. Each diet had a positive effect on symptoms and inflammatory burden; the more exclusionary diets were associated with a better resolution of inflammation.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) is characterized by flares of inflammation with a periodic need for increased medication and sometimes even surgery. The aetiology of {IBD} is partly attributed to a deregulated immune response to gut microbiome dysbiosis. Cross-sectional studies have revealed microbial signatures for different {IBD} subtypes, including ulcerative colitis, colonic Crohn's disease and ileal Crohn's disease. Although {IBD} is dynamic, microbiome studies have primarily focused on single time points or a few individuals. Here, we dissect the long-term dynamic behaviour of the gut microbiome in {IBD} and differentiate this from normal variation. Microbiomes of {IBD} subjects fluctuate more than those of healthy individuals, based on deviation from a newly defined healthy plane ({HP}). Ileal Crohn's disease subjects deviated most from the {HP}, especially subjects with surgical resection. Intriguingly, the microbiomes of some {IBD} subjects periodically visited the {HP} then deviated away from it. Inflammation was not directly correlated with distance to the healthy plane, but there was some correlation between observed dramatic fluctuations in the gut microbiome and intensified medication due to a flare of the disease. These results will help guide therapies that will redirect the gut microbiome towards a healthy state and maintain remission in {IBD}.},

Sweetness and sourness have generally been known to suppress each other, but often such investigations have focused on aqueous solutions. Investigations into what happens when these known interactions are transferred to more complex solutions are scarce. In this study, we investigated the differences in taste interactions between an aqueous matrix and a cold-brewed coffee matrix. Two sub-studies were conducted. In one, six aqueous samples were evaluated by 152 naïve consumers; in the other six cold-brewed coffee samples were evaluated by 115 naïve consumers. In both studies participants tasted samples with no addition or with addition of either sucrose, citric acid, tartaric acid, or a mix of sucrose and either of the acids. Results showed that the sweetness of sucrose was suppressed by both citric acid and tartaric acid in both matrices. The sourness of both citric acid and tartaric acid was suppressed in the aqueous matrix, but only the sourness of tartaric was suppressed in the coffee matrix. Generally, the suppression was lower in the coffee matrix compared to the aqueous matrix. In conclusion, results from taste interaction studies conducted on aqueous matrices can to some extent, with caution, be interpolated to more complex matrices. Importantly, suppression effects might diminish with an increase in matrix complexity.},

Here, we performed a systematic study of how extraction temperature affects the sensory qualities of full immersion coffee. The investigation used a 3 × 3 × 3 factorial design, with coffee from three different origins representing different post-harvest methods (washed, honey-processed, and wet-hulled), each roasted to three different levels (light, medium, and dark), and each brewed at three different temperatures (4 °C, 22 °C, and 92 °C). All coffees were brewed to equilibrium, then diluted to precisely 2\% total dissolved solids ({TDS}) and served at the same cold temperature (4 °C). We find that four attributes exhibited statistically significant variations with brew temperature for all origins and roast levels tested, with bitter taste, sour taste, and rubber flavor all higher in hot brewed coffees, and floral flavor higher in cold brewed coffee. However, there were strong interactions with origin and roast, with several additional attributes significantly impacted by temperature for specific origins and roast levels. These results provide insight on how brew temperature can be used to modulate the flavor profile of full immersion coffee.},

A total of 129 publications were found to report acid concentration measurements, yielding 8,634 distinct data points. Analysis of the full data set reveals several trends. First, roasted robusta has considerably more acidic compounds than arabica with 2 to 5 times as much total {OAs}, and much larger amounts of formic and acetic acid. As for {CGAs}, in both arabica and robusta 5-{CQA} is the major component, and progressive roasting decreases the concentration of all {CGAs}. The total amount of {CGA} present was more dependent on roast level than the type of coffee (arabica vs. robusta). Overall, this meta-analysis suggests that the increases in certain {OAs} with roast level might play more of a role in the sensory profile of dark roast coffees than previously suspected.},

The amounts of in-mouth odorants exhaled through the nostrils during the consumption of black coffee and milk coffee were compared using the Retronasal Flavor Impression Screening System (R-{FISS}) by 3 trained panelists. As a result, it was found that the amounts of most in-mouth odorants including the potent odorants in brewed coffee did not significantly differ between the black coffee and milk coffee. However, the amounts of furfuryl methyl sulfide ({FMS}), difurylmethane, and furfuryl pyrrole exhaled through the nostrils during the consumption of milk coffee were significantly lower than those of the black coffee regardless of the panelist. It has been previously indicated that {FMS} could result from the methylation of 2-furfurylthiol ({FFT}), one of the most important potent odorants in brewed coffee. Based on these results, {FFT} and {FMS} were added to milk coffee so that the amount of {FMS} exhaled through the nostrils was about the same as that of black coffee, resulting in improved intensity of the coffee-like aroma quality for the milk coffee. The present results suggested that the significantly decreased intensity of the coffee-like aroma quality might result from decreased aroma release of a few odorants, including {FFT}, by the addition of milk to the coffee. Moreover, it was inferred that the difference in aroma release of {FFT} would have an especially significant impact on the perception of coffee-like aroma quality between the black coffee and milk coffee.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to better understand the correspondence between sensory perception and in-nose compound concentration. Five aroma compounds at three different concentrations increasing by factors of 4 were added to four matrixes (water, skim milk, 2.7\% fat milk, and 3.8\% fat milk). These were evaluated by nosespace analysis with detection by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry ({PTR}-{MS}), using five panelists. These same panelists evaluated the perceived intensity of each compound in the matrixes at the three concentrations. {PTR}-{MS} quantification found that the percent released from an aqueous solution swallowed immediately was between 0.1 and 0.6\%, depending on the compound. The nosespace and sensory results showed the expected effect of fat on release, where lipophilic compounds showed reductions in release as fat content increases. The effect is less than that observed in headspace studies. A general correlation between nosespace concentration and sensory intensity ratings was found. However, examples of perceptual masking were found where higher fat milks showed reductions in aroma compound intensity ratings, even if the nosespace concentrations were the same.},

Here, we examine the effect of titratable acidity and {pH} on the perception of sourness and consumer acceptance in drip brew coffee. Sour perception and acidity liking were assessed over a wide range of brew strengths and extraction yields at three different roast levels (light, medium, dark) and three different brewing temperatures (87 °C, 90 °C, and 93 °C). We find that perceived sour intensity correlates weakly with {pH}, but strongly with titratable acidity. Increases in titratable acidity also yielded increases in consumer perception of “too much acidity” and also impacted consumer liking and consumer preference segmentation with one cluster of consumers preferring more acidic coffee. Importantly, our data show that titratable acidity is linearly correlated with total dissolved solids ({TDS}) under all conditions studied, indicating that {TDS} is a good proxy for titratable acidity. The results presented here will provide the coffee industry with insight toward controlling perceived acidity or sourness, a key sensory attribute that substantially impacts consumer acceptance.},

Here, an analysis of nine different extraction methods is presented regarding analytical and sensory aspects for four espressi and five lunghi. This comprised espresso and lungo from a semi-automatic coffee machine, espresso and lungo from a fully automatic coffee machine, espresso from a single-serve capsule system, mocha made with a percolator, lungo prepared with French Press extraction, filter coffee and lungo extracted with a Bayreuth coffee machine. Analytical measurements included headspace analysis with {HS} {SPME} {GC}/{MS}, acidity ({pH}), titratable acidity, content of fatty acids, total solids, refractive indices (expressed in °Brix), caffeine and chlorogenic acids content with {HPLC}. Sensory analysis included visual, aroma, flavor and textural attributes as well as aftersensation. The technical differences in the extraction methods led to a higher concentration of the respective quantities in the espressi than in the lunghi. Regarding the contents per cup of coffee, the lunghi generally had a higher content than the espressi. The extraction efficiency of the respective compounds was mainly driven by their solubility in water. A higher amount of water, as in the extraction of a lungo, generally led to higher extraction efficiency. Comparing analytical data with sensory profiles, the following positive correlations were found total solids ↔ texture/body, headspace intensity ↔ aroma intensity, concentrations of caffeine/chlorogenic acids ↔ bitterness and astringency. © 2013 The Author(s).},

The objective of this study was to observe the changes in physicochemical, antioxidant and sensory properties of espresso coffee during refrigerated storage to determine its shelf-life as ingredient for coffee milk. The analysis used in this study were {pH}, color, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, and sensory test as triangle test and hedonic of flavor, aroma, body, and color. The results showed that espresso coffee has quality degradation in both chemical ({pH} and antioxidant) and sensory properties during refrigerated storage. The lightness of coffee milk made from espresso coffee after four-day storage significantly increased. Although there was changes in {pH} of espresso coffee, it didn't change the {pH} of coffee milk produced. The reduction of antioxidant capacity could be observed from espresso coffee after 2 days storage, while the reduction of total phenolic content was observed after 4-day storage. Interestingly, the highest hedonic score was found in both of coffee products stored for 4 day in the refrigerator. The shelf life of espresso coffee for making coffee milk was six days based on triangle test.},

	abstract = {The separate effects of concentration, {pH} and anion species on intensity of sourness and astringency of organic acids were evaluated. Judges rated sourness and astringency intensity of lactic, malic, tartaric and citric acid solutions at three levels of constant {pH} varying in normality and at three levels of constant concentration varying in {pH}. To assess the comparative sourness and astringency of the organic acid anions of study, binary acid solutions matched in {pH} and titratable acidity were also rated. As {pH} was decreased in equinormal solutions, both sourness and astringency increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.001). By contrast, as the normality of the equi-{pH} solutions was increased, only sourness demonstrated significant increases (P {\textless} 0.001) while astringency remained constant or decreased slightly. At the lowest normality tested, all solutions were more astringent than sour (P {\textless} 0.05). Although lactic acid was found to be significantly more sour than citric acid (P {\textless} 0.05), no other sourness or astringency differences among the organic acid anions were noted. This study demonstrates for the first time that astringency elicited by acids is a function of {pH} and not concentration or anion species, and confirms that sourness is independently influenced by concentration, {pH} and anion species of the acid.},

	abstract = {The composition of the volatile fraction of milk from cows was investigated in a survey of milk samples using a headspace sampling technique and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis ({GC}-{MS}). Milk samples were collected from 12 farms, selected for similar management, breed and level of production. Farms were also grouped according to the type of forage in the ration: (1) hay; (2) hay and maize silage; (3) hay, maize silage and grass silages. Forty-one compounds in milk were isolated and identified from {GC}-{MS} headspace analysis. Quantitatively, the most representative chemical class was ketones (eight compounds, 170 μg/kg), followed by aldehydes (nine compounds, 63 μg/kg), alcohols (eight compounds, 36 μg/kg), and lower amounts of hydrocarbons (six compounds), sulphur compounds (three compounds), esters (four compounds) and terpenes (three compounds). The novel headspace sampling technique, and the consequent reduction of sample pre-treatment, allowed the identification of low-molecular weight volatile compounds, and reduced the risk of producing artefacts during analysis. Discriminant analysis was used to identify a classification criterion for milk samples, using type of forage in the ration as a grouping variable. Posterior probability error rate indicated that aldehydes provided one of the best discriminant criteria for grouping milks according to ration composition. When all 41 identified volatile compounds were included, discriminant analysis selected nine compounds (acetone, 2,3-butanedione, 2-butanone, ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethylacetate, ethyliso-valerate, dimethylsulphone) that did not fail the tolerance test and which correctly classified 100\% of the original cases.},

	abstract = {Although specific interactions between flavor compounds and proteins or carbohydrates are often characterized in simplified model systems, the importance of these effects in more complex fat-containing food is less well-documented. This study determined the relative effects of milk components on flavor compound volatility. Within an experimental design, milk samples with different levels of milk-solids-non-fat ({MSNF}; milk proteins and lactose) and milk fat were compared. The relative amounts of added flavor compounds in the headspace were determined using Solid-Phase Microextraction {GC}-{FID}, using a 1 min adsorption time. Three categories of compound behavior were identified: (1) not influenced by milk component addition (diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, guaiacol), (2) reduced in volatility with milk fat but not with {MSNF} (3-methyl butanal, 2-methylpropanal, 4-ethylguaiacol), (3) reduced in volatility with {MSNF} and much greater reductions with fat (β-damascenone, l-octen-3-one). This last group is the only one that showed flavor compound interactions with milk proteins or lactose. However, when fat was present in the system, the level of {MSNF} did not further influence flavor compound release. This shows that in complex liquid milk systems, compound absorption by fat is the primary retaining mechanism. In addition, measured lipophilicity of the compounds showed a good correlation (R 2 = 0.9) with retention by milk for compounds with k w {\textgreater} 0.7. In our eating experience, flavor compounds exist in the realm of a food product. The final flavor perception is influenced by any chemical interactions with the food components. For this reason, a certain amount of flavor research in recent years has concentrated on a better understanding of these interactions. Proteins, for example, have been shown to bind to certain flavor compounds with measurable binding},

Therefore, investigation of consumers' perceptions of the taste or smell of common beverages provides information that should be useful in predicting market responses. In this study, we sought to develop a time-intensity evaluation system for consumer panels. Using our system, we performed time-intensity evaluation of flavor attributes (bitterness and retronasal aroma) that consumers perceived after swallowing a coffee beverage. Additionally, we developed quantitative evaluation methods for determining whether consumer panelists can properly perform time-intensity evaluation. In every trial, we fitted an exponential function to measured intensity data for bitterness and retronasal aroma. The correlation coefficients between measured time-intensity data and the fitted exponential curves were greater than 0.8 in about 90\% of trials, indicating that we had successfully developed a time-intensity system for use with consumer panelists, even after just a single training trial using a nontrained consumer. We classified participants into two groups based on their consumption of canned coffee beverages. Significant difference was observed in only {AUC} of sensory modality (bitterness compared with retronasal aroma) among conventional {TI} parameters using two-way {ANOVA}. However, three-way {ANOVA} including a time course revealed significant difference between bitterness and retronasal aroma in the high-consumption group. Moreover, the high-consumption group more easily discriminated between bitterness and retronasal aroma than the low-consumption group. This finding implied that manufacturers should select consumer panelists who are suitable for their concepts of new products.},

	abstract = {Coffee is one of the most common beverages in the world. However, a sensory lexicon for determining descriptive differences resulting from breeding, agronomic, processing, storage, and brewing modifications is needed. This study developed a sensory lexicon for brewed coffee. More than 100 different coffee samples from 14 countries around the world were used to create this lexicon in four Phases. A highly trained panel assessed all coffee samples using descriptive analysis. The sensory panel identified 110 attributes (many used both for aroma and flavor) and references. Principal component analysis was used to map the scores obtained during the validation phase. For this phase the coffee lexicon allowed the panelists to describe specific characteristics that were present in the coffee samples such as sweet, nutty and fruity notes, as well as the differentiation of notes such as burnt, smoky, astringent, acrid and bitter. The developed attributes and references were successfully used by the trained panel to describe a wide range of coffee samples. The lexicon is considered “living” because additional terms should be added as needed to expand the lexicon to include attributes that are not included here. Practical applications: The terminology developed during this study is clear, easy to reproduce in future research, and accompanied by reference standards that provide a guide for future studies. This lexicon will provide an important tool for the coffee industry to conduct sensory evaluation to improve the understanding of coffee quality. It is a “living” lexicon that can be added to when samples exhibit notes that were not present in the samples used for this lexicon development.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the over-all process of hearing depends upon proper interpretation of the results of many individual experiments. In the field of subjective experimentation the problem has been complicated by the wide variety of test procedures that characterize available data. If a common technique could be applied to the many different types of auditory tests, such as thresholds of acuity, masking tests, difference limens, etc., the organization of these data would be facilitated. The purpose of the present paper is to describe a test procedure which has shown promise in this direction and to give descriptions of equipment which have been found helpful in minimizing the variability of the test results. The procedure, which we have called the “{ABX}” test, is a modification of the method of paired comparisons. An observer is presented with a time sequence of three signals for each judgment he is asked to make. During the first time interval he hears signal A, during the second, signal B, and finally signal X. His task is to indicate whether the sound heard during the X interval was more like that during the A interval or more like that during the B interval. For a threshold test, the A interval is quiet, the B interval is signal, and the X interval is either quiet or signal. For a masking test, A is the masking signal, B is the masking signal plus the signal being masked, and X is either A or B repeated. The apparatus for the {ABX} test is mechanized so all details of the method can be duplicated for each observer, and the variability of manual operation eliminated. The entire test is coded on teletype tape to reduce the time and effort of collecting large quantities of data.},

	abstract = {Taste-taste and flavor-taste interactions (suppression) in caffeine-sucrose and coffee-sucrose mixtures were determined. Similar interactions for both types of mixtures showed an extended hypoadditivity effect for overall taste or flavor intensity (percentage of suppression about 30-40\%). Futhermore, mutual suppression among the components has been determined. Firstly, the physical intensity of the suppressive component controls the amount of suppression of the other component. Thus, the suppression of bitterness and coffee flavor qualities increase when sucrose levels increase, and similarly, the suppression of sweetness increases when caffeine or coffee levels rise. Secondly, the magnitude of suppression depends upon the quality of the suppressive component. Comparisons of the reciprocal actions were made at similar subjective intensities of the mixture's constituents in isolation. The results showed that, at similar perceived intensities, caffeine bitterness or coffee flavor were suppressed by sucrose but sweetness was not affected by caffeine or coffee.},

	abstract = {Referral of retronasal odors to the mouth is a fundamental phenomenon of flavor perception. A previous study from this laboratory provided evidence that, contrary to prior speculation, taste rather than touch was the primary factor in retronasal odor referral. The present study further investigated this question by studying the role of congruency between taste and odor on retronasal odor referral under conditions that mimicked natural food consumption. Subjects performed odor localization tasks after sampling gelatin stimuli that contained various congruent and incongruent tastes-odor combinations. The results showed that when a congruent taste was added, referral to the oral cavity and tongue were significantly enhanced. In addition, the data also indicate that the degree of congruency between taste and odor may modulate the degree of odor referral to the mouth. These findings suggest that odor referral is maximized when congruent flavor dimensions are combined to trigger perceptual "flavor objects" that represent known or potential foods. The results are discussed in terms of the factors that play a role in the retronasal odor referral as well as the potential neural mechanisms that may underlie it. © The Author 2012.

For sugars, the roasted bean increase content in all samples, consequence of the breakdown of sucrose and other polysaccharides generating reducing sugars. To protein, roasted beans of coffee with quality beverage, there were a decrease in soluble proteins when comparing green beans, but in coffee of down quality, there were increase of protein in beverage.

Although the percentages of vegetarians and vegans are low compared to omnivores, their numbers have increased significantly in the last years. The use of non-animal food products other than meat alternatives is also increasing and this tendency constitutes an opportunity for the food industry. In this review, we present that plant-based meat and milk alternatives are consolidated but that there is a niche for egg, seafood alternatives, and new products which may not resemble any traditional animal food. However, not all animal food substitutes are sustainable and some of them are even ultra-processed. In addition, there are concerns on safety and labeling, and consumers demand clear information and regulation. The challenges in this field are connected with food design and technology, sensory science, nutrition, and dietetics. Moreover, adequate selection and combination of foods is important in order to achieve consumer acceptance while preventing nutritional deficiencies in those who choose this type of diet.},

Four attributes were considered in the conjoint study: type of yogurt (regular, enriched with antioxidants and enriched with fibre), brand (national familiar, national unfamiliar, and foreign familiar), price (low, regular and high) and claim (with and without 'reduced disease risk' health claim). Eighteen choice sets, each composed of three stimuli (regular yogurt, enriched with antioxidants and enriched with fibre and varying the brand, price and claim levels) were evaluated by 103 consumers. For each choice set, consumers had to indicate which yogurt would normally buy. A questionnaire on consumer attitude towards health and nutrition was answered by participants after the choice task. Brand, price and health claims highly significantly affected consumer choice of functional yogurts. The relative importance of brand was similar to that of type of yogurt. Therefore, results suggested that non-sensory factors such as brand and price could have an important impact on consumer perception of functional foods. The impact of brand, price and health claims was affected by consumer interest in health issues. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The mode of action of {OTA} is not clearly understood yet, and seems to be very complex. Inhibition of protein synthesis and energy production, induction of oxidative stress, {DNA} adduct formation, as well as apoptosis/necrosis and cell cycle arrest are possibly involved in its toxic action. Since {OTA} binds very strongly to human and animal albumin, a major emphasis is done regarding {OTA}-albumin interaction. Displacement of {OTA} from albumin by drugs and by natural flavonoids are discussed in detail, hypothesizing their potentially beneficial effect in order to prevent or attenuate the {OTA}-induced toxic consequences.},

Using {UK} and {US} cohorts, we test the hypotheses that genetic variants related to taste are more strongly associated with consumption of black coffee than with consumption of coffee with milk or sweetener and that genetic variants related to caffeine pathways are not differentially associated with the type of coffee consumed independent of caffeine content. Contrary to our hypotheses, genetically inferred caffeine sensitivity was more strongly associated with coffee taste preferences than with genetically inferred bitter taste perception.

Methods: Liking of espresso coffee from food questionnaire and of a ready-to-drink unsweetened coffee beverage was measured using a 9-point hedonic scale in 1551 Italian individuals. Perception and liking for different bitter and sweet compounds were also collected. Genotyping of selected Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in five taste genes ({TAS}1R3, {GNAT}3, {TAS}2R14, {TAS}2R19, {TAS}2R38) was performed. Linear and logistic regression models, including sex and gender as covariates, were used to test the relationship of taste phenotypes and selected {SNPs} with coffee liking. Results: We found that increased caffeine bitterness perception was associated with an increasing liking for sweetened coffee (p-value = 0.018) and decreased liking of unsweetened coffee (p-value = 0.034). The liking of unsweetened coffee beverage was also negatively associated with sweet intensity perception (p-value = 0.03). Analysis of {SNPs} in taste-related genes showed that rs6467192 G allele (intron 4 variant) in {GNAT}3 sweet taste gene was associated with higher liking of sweetened coffee (p-value = 0.002) and lower liking of unsweetened coffee (p-value = 0.01). An association also emerged between unsweetened coffee and {SNPs} in bitter receptor genes, with rs2597979 in {TAS}2R14 gene associated with liking of unsweetened coffee (p-value = 0.004) and rs10772420 in {TAS}2R19 gene associated with liking of both unsweetened espresso coffee and coffee beverage (p-value = 0.04 and p-value = 0.03, respectively).

How such variation also affects odor experience and food selection remains uncertain [10], given that such effects occur for taste [11-15]. Here we investigate β-ionone, which shows extreme sensitivity differences [4, 16, 17]. β-ionone is a key aroma in foods and beverages [18-21] and is added to products in order to give a pleasant floral note [22, 23]. Genome-wide and in vitro assays demonstrate rs6591536 as the causal variant for β-ionone odor sensitivity. rs6591536 encodes a N183D substitution in the second extracellular loop of {OR}5A1 and explains {\textgreater}96\% of the observed phenotypic variation, resembling a monogenic Mendelian trait. Individuals carrying genotypes for β-ionone sensitivity can more easily differentiate between food and beverage stimuli with and without added β-ionone. Sensitive individuals typically describe β-ionone in foods and beverages as "fragrant" and "floral," whereas less-sensitive individuals describe these stimuli differently. rs6591536 genotype also influences emotional associations and explains differences in food and product choices.

	abstract = {The perceived taste intensities of quinine {HCl}, caffeine, sucrose octaacetate ({SOA}) and propylthiouracil ({PROP}) solutions were examined in 1457 twins and their siblings. Previous heritability modeling of these bitter stimuli indicated a common genetic factor for quinine, caffeine and {SOA} (22-28\%), as well as separate specific genetic factors for {PROP} (72\%) and quinine (15\%). To identify the genes involved, we performed a genome-wide association study with the same sample as the modeling analysis, genotyped for approximately 610 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}). For caffeine and {SOA}, no {SNP} association reached a genome-wide statistical criterion. For {PROP}, the peak association was within {TAS}2R38 (rs713598, A49P, P = 1.6 × 10-104), which accounted for 45.9\% of the trait variance. For quinine, the peak association was centered in a region that contains bitter receptor as well as salivary protein genes and explained 5.8\% of the trait variance ({TAS}2R19, rs10772420, R299C, P = 1.8 × 10-15). We confirmed this association in a replication sample of twins of similar ancestry (P = 0.00001). The specific genetic factor for the perceived intensity of {PROP} was identified as the gene previously implicated in this trait ({TAS}2R38). For quinine, one or more bitter receptor or salivary proline-rich protein genes on chromosome 12 have alleles which affect its perception but tight linkage among very similar genes precludes the identification of a single causal genetic variant. © The Author 2010.

	abstract = {Repeated exposure can change the perceptual and hedonic features of flavor. Associative learning during which a flavor's odor component is affected by co-exposure with taste is thought to be central in this process. However, changes can also arise due to exposure to the odor in itself. The aim of this study was to dissociate effects of associative learning from effects of exposure without taste by repeatedly presenting one odor together with sucrose and a second odor alone. Sixty individuals attended two testing sessions separated by a 5-day Exposure Phase during which the stimuli were presented as flavorants in chewing gums that were chewed three times daily. Ratings of odor sweetness, odor pleasantness, odor intensity enhancement by taste, and odor referral to the mouth were collected at both sessions. Consistent with the notion that food preferences are modulated by exposure, odor pleasantness increased between the sessions independently of whether the odor (basil or orange flower) had been presented with or without sucrose. However, we found no evidence of associative learning in any of the tasks. In addition, exploratory equivalence tests suggested that these effects were either absent or insignificant in magnitude. Taken together, our results suggest that the hypothesized effects of associative learning are either smaller than previously thought or highly dependent on the experimental setting. Future studies are needed to evaluate the relative support for these explanations and, if experimental conditions can be identified that reliably produce such effects, to identify factors that regulate the formation of new odor-taste associations.},

An extinction procedure, consisting of postconditioning presentations of the odor in water, had no detectable effect on the changed perception of an odor (Experiments 3 and 4). In contrast, this procedure altered judgments about the expected taste of colored solutions. Evaluative conditioning (conditioned changes in liking) is claimed to be resistant to extinction.

	abstract = {The current study took a first step toward elucidating the sensory input that drives retronasal odor referral to the mouth. In 2 experiments, subjects performed odor localization tasks under various oral-nasal stimulation conditions that allowed us to assess the effects of direction of airflow, taste, and tactile stimulation on retronasal odor referral. Subjects reported the locations of perceived odors when food odorants were inhaled through the mouth alone or in the presence of water or various tastants in the mouth. The results indicated that when perceived alone, vanilla and soy sauce odor were localized 54.7\%: 26.4\%: 18.9\% and 60.0\%: 21.7\%: 18.3\% in the nose, oral cavity, and on the tongue, respectively. The localization of odors alone was not significantly different from when water was presented simultaneously in the mouth, indicating that tactile stimulation itself is not sufficient to enhance odor referral. However, the presence of sucrose, but not other tastes, significantly increased localization of vanilla to the tongue. Likewise, only {NaCl} significantly augmented referral of soy sauce odor to the tongue. These data indicate that referral of retronasal odors to the mouth can occur in the absence of a either taste or touch but that referral to the tongue depends strongly on the presence of a congruent taste. © The Author 2010.

Food-related odors have also been shown to increase rated appetite, and induce salivation and release of gastric acid and insulin. However, our ability to identify an odor as food-related, and our liking for food-related odors, are both learned responses. In conditioning studies, repeated experience of odors with sweet and sour tastes result in enhanced ratings of sensory quality of the paired taste for the odor on its own. More recent studies also report increased pleasantness ratings for odors paired with sucrose for participants who like sweet tastes, and conversely decreased liking and increased bitterness for quinine-paired odors. When odors were experienced in combination with sucrose when hungry, liking was not increased if tested sated, suggesting that expression of acquired liking for odors depends on current motivational state. Other studies report sensory-specific satiety is seen with food-related odors. Overall, these studies suggest that once an odor is experienced in a food-related context, that odor acquires the ability to modify both preparatory and satiety-related components of ingestion. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Human ingestive behavior depends on myriad factors, including both sensory and non-sensory determinants. Of the sensory determinants, sweet taste is a powerful stimulus and liking for sweetness is widely accepted as an innate human trait. However, the universality of sweet-liking has been challenged. Sub-groups exhibiting strong liking (sweet likers) or having aversive responses to sweet taste (sweet dislikers) have been described, but the methods defining these phenotypes are varied and inconsistent across studies. Here, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of different methodological approaches in identifying sweet taste liker phenotypes in a comprehensive review. Prior studies (N = 71) using aqueous sucrose solution-based taste tests and a definition of two or more distinct hedonic responses reported between 1970 and 2017 were summarized. Broadly speaking, four different phenotyping methods have been used: 1. Interpretation (visual or statistical) of the shape of hedonic response curves, 2. Highest preference using ratings, 3. Average liking above mid-point or Positive/Negative average liking method, and 4. Highest preference via paired comparisons. Key methodological weaknesses included the use of subjective or arbitrary criteria as well as adoption of protocols unsuitable for large-scale implementation. Overall, we did not identify a method distinctly superior to the others. Given the role of both hedonics and reward in food intake, a better understanding of individual variations in sweet taste perception could clarify how sweet-liking interplays with obesity or addictive behaviors such as alcohol misuse and abuse. The development of a universally used statistically robust and less time-consuming classification method is needed.},

	abstract = {The milk protein β-casein (β-{CN}) is an intrinsically unstructured amphiphilic protein that self-assembles into micelles. Naringenin is the main hydrophobic flavanone in grapefruit and has several beneficial biological effects: it exhibits, for example, antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. This paper shows that naringenin can be encapsulated in β-{CN} micelles. Fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular docking modelling, dynamic light scattering ({DLS}), static light scattering ({SLS}) and isothermal titration calorimetry ({ITC}) were applied to characterize the effect of naringenin on the protein association behavior and properties of the resulting micelles. Naringenin binds to β-{CN} at both {pH} 7 and {pH} 2, promotes the formation of micelles with a well-defined size distribution and stabilizes the micelles. It was found that naringenin-containing β-{CN} micelles have a lower critical micelle concentration ({CMC}) and a larger aggregation number (Nagg) compared to pure β-{CN} micelles. {SLS} and multi-angle {DLS} results suggest considerable differences between the structures of pure β-{CN} micelles and naringenin-containing β-{CN} micelles. In the presence of naringenin spherical micelles were formed with a relatively loose core (“hollow sphere”), while the pure β-{CN} micelles are smaller and seem to be elliptic. Notably, by uptake of naringenin in the micelles, the concentration of naringenin in aqueous solution could be raised considerably. These findings lead to the conclusion that β-{CN} micelles are very promising as effective delivery nano-vehicles for hydrophobic bioactive compounds.},

	abstract = {Interaction of flavor compounds with proteins is known to have an influence on the release of flavor from food. Hydrophobic interactions were found between β-lactoglobulin and methyl ketones; the affinity constant increases by increasing the hydrophobic chain. Addition of β-lactoglobulin (0.5 and 1\%) to aroma solutions (12.5, 50, and 100 μL L-1) of three methyl ketones induces a significant decrease in odor intensity. The chosen methyl ketones were 2-heptanone (K(b) = 330), 2-octanone (K(b) = 950), and 2-nonanone (K(b) = 2440). The release of these flavor compounds (50 μL L-1) was studied by static headspace in water solution (50 {mM} {NaCl}, {pH} 3) with different concentrations of β-lactoglobulin (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4\%). Increasing the concentration of protein increases the retention of volatiles, and this effect is greatest for 2-nonanone, the compound with the highest affinity constant, and lowest for 2-heptanone. A mathematical model previously developed to describe flavor release from aqueous solutions containing flavor-binding polymers (Harrison, M.; Hills, B. P. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997, 45, 1883-1890) was used to interpret the data. The model assumes that the polymer-flavor interaction is reversible and the rate-limiting step for release is the transfer of volatiles across the macroscopic gas-liquid interface. This model was used to predict the equilibrium partitioning properties and the rate of release of the three methyl ketones. Increasing the affinity constant leads to decreased release rates and a lower final headspace aroma concentration.},

With the knowledge of flavor partition coefficients, the distribution of aroma compounds within the food matrix and towards the headspace can be calculated. In this study static headspace measurements and modelling are combined to predict flavor partitioning of a wide range of flavor compounds above fat-free dairy protein mixture solutions. {AFFIRM}® (based on Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-Mass Spectrometry) was used to measure the static headspace concentrations of 9 flavor compounds (3 esters, 3 aldehydes and 3 alcohols) above protein solutions with different concentrations and ratios of sodium caseinate and whey protein isolate. Proteins had a small pushing out effect, leading to increased release of hydrophilic flavor compounds. This effect was negligible for more hydrophobic compounds, where clear retention was observed. An increased total protein concentration and higher whey to casein ratio increased the retention for all flavor compounds. Within the same chemical class, the retention increased with chain length. The experimental data was interpreted with a model describing flavor partitioning in protein solutions (Harrison \& Hills, 1997), thereby enabling to extract protein-flavor binding constants. A clear power law was found between the protein-flavor binding constant and log P (octanol-water partition coefficient). Assuming solely non-specific hydrophobic interactions gave satisfying partitioning predictions for the esters and alcohols. For aldehydes specific chemical interactions with proteins turned out to be significant. This rendered a binding constant for whey protein that is 5 times higher than for caseinate in case of esters and alcohols, and 3 times higher in case of aldehydes. The model can accurately predict equilibrium flavor partitioning in dairy protein mixtures with only the knowledge of the octanol-water partition coefficients of the flavor compounds, and the composition of the protein mixture.},

	abstract = {Phenolic acids are added to some dairy products as functional ingredients. The molecular interactions between the phenolic acids and milk proteins impacts their functional performance and product quality. In this study, the interactions between a milk protein (β-casein) and a number of phenolic acids was investigated: 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid ({DA}); gallic acid ({GA}); syringic acid ({SA}); caffeic acid ({CaA}); ferulic acid ({FA}); and, chlorogenic acid ({ChA}). The structural characteristics of the phenolic acids, such as type, hydroxylation, methylation, and steric hindrance, affected their binding affinity to β-casein. The strength of the binding constant decreased in the following order: {CaA} {\textgreater} {ChA} {\textgreater} {FA} {\textgreater} {SA} {\textgreater} {GA} {\textgreater} {DA}. Cinnamic acid derivatives ({CaA}, {FA}, and {ChA}) exhibited a stronger binding affinity with β-casein than benzoic acid derivatives ({DA}, {GA}, and {SA}). Hydrophobic forces and electrostatic interactions dominated the interactions of β-casein with benzoic acid and cinnamic acid derivatives, respectively. The number of hydroxyl groups on the phenolic acids enhanced their binding ability, while steric hindrance effects reduced their binding ability. The influence of methylation depended on phenolic acid type. After binding with phenolic acids, the conformation of the β-casein changed, with a loss of random coil structure, an increase in α-helix structure, and a decrease in surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the presence of β-casein decreased the in vitro antioxidant capacities of the phenolic acids, especially for gallic acid. These findings provide some useful insights into the structure–activity relationships of the interaction between β-casein and phenolic acids.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is associated with several oropharyngeal abnormalities, including buccal sensory sensitivity, taste and texture aversions, speech apraxia, and salivary transcriptome alterations. Furthermore, the oropharynx represents the sole entry point to the gastrointestinal ({GI}) tract. {GI} disturbances and alterations in the {GI} microbiome are established features of {ASD}, and may impact behavior through the “microbial-gut-brain axis.” Most studies of the {ASD} microbiome have used fecal samples. Here, we identified changes in the salivary microbiome of children aged 2–6 years across three developmental profiles: {ASD} (n = 180), nonautistic developmental delay ({DD}; n = 60), and typically developing ({TD}; n = 106) children. After {RNA} extraction and shotgun sequencing, actively transcribing taxa were quantified and tested for differences between groups and within {ASD} endophenotypes. A total of 12 taxa were altered between the developmental groups and 28 taxa were identified that distinguished {ASD} patients with and without {GI} disturbance, providing further evidence for the role of the gut-brain axis in {ASD}. Group classification accuracy was visualized with receiver operating characteristic curves and validated using a 50/50 hold-out procedure. Five microbial ratios distinguished {ASD} from {TD} participants (79.5\% accuracy), three distinguished {ASD} from {DD} (76.5\%), and three distinguished {ASD} children with/without {GI} disturbance (85.7\%). Taxonomic pathways were assessed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes microbial database and compared with one-way analysis of variance, revealing significant differences within energy metabolism and lysine degradation. Together, these results indicate that {GI} microbiome disruption in {ASD} extends to the oropharynx, and suggests oral microbiome profiling as a potential tool to evaluate {ASD} status.

For that purpose, the tongue film and saliva of 21 healthy subjects were characterized, focusing on microorganisms and their main metabolic substrates and products. In parallel, taste sensitivity was evaluated using a test recently developed by our group, and the links between biological and sensory data were explored by a correlative approach. Saliva and tongue film differed significantly in biochemical composition (proportions of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and lactic, butyric, and acetic acids) and in microbiological profiles: compared to saliva, tongue film was characterized by significantly lower proportions of Bacteroidetes (p{\textless}0.001) and its main genus Prevotella (p{\textless}0.01) and significantly higher proportions of Firmicutes (p{\textless}0.01), Actinobacteria (p{\textless}0.001), and the genus Streptococcus (p{\textless}0.05). Generic taste sensitivity was linked to biological variables in the two compartments, but variables that appeared influent in saliva (flow, organic acids, proportion of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes) and in tongue film (sugars and proportions of Bacteroidetes) were not the same. This study points to two interesting areas in taste research: the oral microbiome and the specific characterization of the film lining the tongue.},

There is a possibility, however, that the odor substances might have stimulated the taste receptors in the oral cavity as well as odor receptors in the nasal cavity because the odor substances were dissolved in the taste solutions in some preceding studies. Schifferstein and Verlegh (1996) found that the odor-induced taste enhancement effect was not found when the subjects wore a nose clip to prevent the olfactory perception. Thus, it was suggested that the odor-induced taste enhancement did not result from the stimulation of receptors in the oral cavity. To confirm and extend their study, we presented the odor stimuli simultaneously with, but not dissolved in, the taste stimuli with a more advanced approach to stimulus presentation.

First, the impact of 6 odorants, previously described in the literature as congruent with sweetness, was investigated at suprathreshold level in a sucrose solution.

Second, the impact on sweetness of the 2 odorants was investigated at subthreshold concentrations. A system delivering a continuous liquid flow at the same sucrose level, but with varying odorant concentrations, was used. At a subthreshold level, ethyl butyrate but not maltol significantly enhanced the sweetness of the sucrose solution. This study highlights that olfactory perception induced by odorants at a subthreshold level can significantly modulate taste perception. Finally, contrary to results observed with ethyl butyrate at suprathreshold levels, at subthreshold levels, the intensity of sweetness enhancement was not proportional to ethyl butyrate concentration.},

	doi = {10.1002/hbm.21414},
	abstract = {Excessive intake of dietary salt (sodium chloride) may increase the risk of chronic diseases. Accordingly, various strategies to reduce salt intake have been conducted. This study aimed to investigate whether a salty-congruent odor can enhance saltiness on the basis of psychophysical (Experiment 1) and neuroanatomical levels (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, after receiving one of six stimulus conditions: three odor conditions (odorless air, congruent, or incongruent odor) by two concentrations (low or high) of either salty or sweet taste solution, participants were asked to rate taste intensity and pleasantness. In Experiment 2, participants received the same stimuli during the functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. In Experiment 1, compared with an incongruent odor and/or odorless air, a congruent odor enhanced not only taste intensity but also either pleasantness of sweetness or unpleasantness of saltiness. In Experiment 2, a salty-congruent combination of odor and taste produced significantly higher neuronal activations in brain regions associated with odor–taste integration (e.g., insula, frontal operculum, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex) than an incongruent combination and/or odorless air with taste solution. In addition, the congruent odor-induced saltiness enhancement was more pronounced in the low-concentrated tastant than in the high-concentrated one. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the congruent odor-induced saltiness enhancement on the basis of psychophysical and neuroanatomical results. These findings support an alternative strategy to reduce excessive salt intake by adding salty-congruent aroma to sodium reduced food.

One factor that may dictate where an odor is perceived to be is concurrent gustatory stimulation in the mouth. A taste may impair the ability to attend to an odor, especially if they are perceptually similar. Alternatively, salient mouth-based features of a flavor might command attention at the expense of smell. Experiment 1 and 2, using different stimulus sets, explored the impact of perceptually similar and dissimilar pairings of tastes in the mouth and odors at the nose. In each case, these were followed by judgments of the odor’s location (mouth vs. nose). Perceptual similarity had no impact on localization judgments. Experiment 3 then manipulated the salience of the olfactory and gustatory cues and showed that each could independently shift the perceived location of an odorant—salient olfactory cues toward the nose and gustatory cues toward the mouth. These findings suggest that the salient features of a flavor may command attention at the expense of olfaction and, thereby, contribute to oral localization, with implications for flavor binding.},

In several instances, but not all, measured probabilities exceeded those predicted by probability summation, indicating that hyperadditive mixing often occurs, but there do seem to be individual differences.

	title = {Odor–Taste Interactions: Effects of Attentional Strategies during Exposure},
	volume = {29},
	doi = {10.1093/chemse/bjh036},
	abstract = {Through repeated pairings with a tastant such as sucrose, odors are able to take on the tastant’s qualities, e.g. by becoming more sweet smelling. When such odors are subsequently experienced with a sweet tastant in solution, the mixture is often given a higher sweetness rating than the tastant alone. Odor-induced taste enhancement appears to be sensitive to whether an odor–taste combination is viewed analytically as a set of discrete qualities, or synthetically as a flavor. The present research attempted to determine if adoption of these different perceptual approaches during co-exposure with sucrose would influence the extent to which an odor would become sweet smelling and subsequently enhance sweetness intensity. In Experiment 1, subjects received multiple exposures to mixtures of sucrose with low sweetness, low familiarity odors or, as a control, the odors and sucrose solutions separately. Two groups that received mixtures made intensity ratings that promoted either synthesis or analysis of the individual elements in the mixtures. The odors became sweeter smelling irrespective of group. Only adopting a synthetic strategy produced odors that enhanced sweetness in solution. However, these effects were also shown with a ‘nonexposed’ control odor. This could be accounted for if the single co-exposure with sucrose that all odors received in the pre-test was able to produce sweeter odors. A second experiment confirmed this prediction. Thus, while even a single co-exposure with sucrose is sufficient to produce a sweeter odor, the adoption of a synthetic perceptual strategy during the co-exposure is necessary to produce an odor that will enhance sweetness. These data are consistent with associative leaning accounts of how odors take on taste qualities and also support the interpretation that these effects reflect the central integration of odors and tastes into flavors.},

Aroma concentration had a signiﬁcant effect on the majority of the sensory attributes. Color had a signiﬁcant effect on perception of some of the aroma attributes, as well as the grapefruit’s ﬂavor intensity. Consumers liked the red beverages more than the yellow ones, and those with low aroma over the high aroma intensity. Consumers preferred the low bitter/high sweet beverages. Pungent and grapefruit aroma were found to be negative drivers for liking of the aroma. Sweet and citrus ﬂavors were found to be positive drivers and sour and bitter ﬂavors were found to be negative drivers of ﬂavor-preferences (or liking) of the tested beverages.},

When brewing, the particle aggregates affect liquid-solid accessibility, leading to variable extraction quality. Here, we study four charge mitigation strategies. De-electrification is readily achieved by adding small amounts of water to whole beans or by bombarding the grounds with ions produced from a high-voltage ionizer. While these techniques helped reduce visible mess, only water inclusion was found to impact coffee extracts prepared as espresso. There, wetting whole beans with less than 0.05 {mL} / g resulted in a marked shift in particle size distribution, by preventing clump formation and preventing fine particles from sticking to the grinder. This particle size shift results in at least 15\% higher coffee concentration for espresso extracts prepared from darker roasts. These findings encourage the widespread implementation of water use to de-electrify coffee during grinding with the benefit of increased coffee extraction efficiency.},

            Coffee is prepared by the extraction of a complex array of organic molecules from the roasted bean, which has been ground into fine particulates. The extraction depends on temperature, water chemistry and also the accessible surface area of the coffee. Here we investigate whether variations in the production processes of single origin coffee beans affects the particle size distribution upon grinding. We find that the particle size distribution is independent of the bean origin and processing method. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of bean temperature on particle size distribution, concluding that grinding cold results in a narrower particle size distribution, and reduced mean particle size. We anticipate these results will influence the production of coffee industrially, as well as contribute to how we store and use coffee daily.},

In an effort to understand this aversion, we surveyed online samples of adults living in the {USA} and India to participate in a study on ‘attitudes toward food’. A substantial proportion of both Americans (72\%) and Indians (74\%) were at least willing to consider eating some form of insect food. Men were more willing to try eating insects than were women, especially in the {USA}. Disgust seems to be the most common reaction of both groups at the prospect of eating insects. The most common perceived benefits of eating insects were related to nutrition and environmental sustainability, and the most common risks related to risk of disease and illness. Both groups find ants the most palatable of a set of seven possible insects, and cockroaches the most unpalatable. In both samples, participants were most amenable to eating low levels of insect flour in a favourite food, and most averse to consuming whole insects. The best predictors of insect acceptance were disgust at the thought of eating insects, beliefs about the benefits of eating insects, sensation seeking, and the enjoyment of telling others about consumption of unusual foods.},

	abstract = {The possibility of removing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural ({HMF}) and furfural from roasted coffee by application of vacuum treatments was studied. In particular, different combinations of pressure and time were used. Results showed that the vacuum treatment was ineffective in removing {HMF} and furfural from anhydrous (commercial) coffee powder, while it proved effective if applied to previously hydrated samples. Besides, the hydration step alone was responsible for furfurals removal, although prolonged times were needed. By applying a hydration step up to aw 0.7, followed by a vacuum treatment at 2.7 {kPa} and 60 °C for 10 min, 20\% and 100\% {HMF} and furfural removals were achieved, respectively. These differences in the percentages of {HMF} and furfural removal can be attributed to differences in the chemical and physical properties of the two molecules. However, the vacuum treatments caused a signiﬁcant decrease in the coffee headspace total volatiles that in turn was responsible for a lower odour intensity of the samples. Therefore further studies are needed to reveal process conditions able to minimise the loss of sensory properties, making this technology a reliable strategy to mitigate the furfural contents in coffee.},

	abstract = {Sensory and consumer testing are primary strategies companies use to collect insights about consumer products. However, frequently, unreliable results from these tests can lead to failed product launches which can have enormous financial and/or brand equity consequences. One potential reason is sensory tasks are often deliberately devoid of additional stimulation which reasonably has the possibility to reduce a panelist’s engagement with the task. Engagement may drive involvement and focus during testing and help generate reliable data. The overall objective of this study was to develop (Study 1), refine (Study 2), and validate (Studies 3–5) an engagement questionnaire ({EQ}), a tool to empirically assess varying engagement levels with a task. Prior literature and an exploratory qualitative assessment through an online platform (Study 1, N = 87) were used to operationalize the dimensionality of engagement and develop a preliminary questionnaire consisting of 54 items covering 7 themes (ability, attention, passivity, involvement, interest, motivation, and relevance). To assess the effectiveness of the initial item set, participants recalled being engaged with a task and answered the preliminary {EQ} (Study 2, N = 186). Results collected underwent an exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) in order to explore the dimensionality and refine the scale by strategically eliminating items. To validate the tool, the {EQ} was distributed following numerous consumer sensory tests that spanned a variety of food and beverage products, test lengths, number, and types of questions (Studies 3–5). {EFA} was conducted in Study 3 (N = 774), which resulted in a three-factor, 10-item model with good reliability (α = 0.856). The new model was subsequently validated in two additional consumer sensory studies (Study 4A, N = 416 and Study 4B, N = 446). Both validation studies produced acceptable to good model fit indices with an {RMSEA} below 0.07, {SRMR} below 0.04, both {CFI} and {TLI} above 0.95 and good reliability (α {\textgreater} 0.850). When tested in a different sensory testing facility, the {EQ} produced acceptable model fit indices (Study 5, N = 247) and tracked as expected with participants’ perceived workload collected using the {NASA} Task Load Index; confirming the content and convergent and divergent validity of the instrument. Such an instrument allows for deeper understanding of panelist engagement and its impact on data quality, enabling the design of sensory tests capable of generating more reliable data both within the field of food science and beyond.},

This study characterized the important aroma-active compounds associated with consumer liking in formulated coffee-flavored dairy beverages. Nine coffee-flavored dairy beverages were formulated: low fat–low coffee; medium fat–low coffee; high fat–low coffee; low fat–medium coffee; medium fat–medium coffee; high fat–medium coffee; low fat–high coffee; medium fat–high coffee; and high fat–high coffee. Regular coffee consumers, (n = 231) used a nine-point hedonic scale to rate acceptance of aroma. Volatile compounds were extracted by head spacesolid phase micro-extraction ({HS}-{SPME}) and analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry-olfactometry ({GC}-{MS}-O) using a modified frequency ({MF}) approach. Fifty-two aroma-active compounds were detected. Thirty-one aromaactive compounds were considered important compounds with {MF}-value ≥ 50\%. The total number of aroma-active compounds and their intensity were affected because of fat and coffee concentration. Partial least squares regression ({PLSR}) was performed to determine the relationship between aroma-active compounds and liking. {PLSR} analysis identified three groups of compounds regarding liking. Twenty-five compounds were associated with positive liking, for example, 2-(methylsulfanylmethyl) furan (coffee like). Sixteen compounds were negatively associated with liking, for example, 2-methoxyphenol (bacon, medicine like). Eleven detected compounds had no association with liking, for example, butane2,3-dione (butter, fruit like).},

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that eating behaviour is not only influenced by factors associated with the individual alone (e.g. psychological/physiological states) but also by the external factors determining the surrounding environment in which one eats (e.g. lighting, colour, temperature, or music). The present research examines the extent to which specific musical properties, namely tempo and articulation, influence eating duration. Two experiments were conducted in which participants tasted and evaluated pieces of chocolate under the influence of different sound conditions. The participants were not aware that they were being timed while eating. For Experiment 1, two versions of the same composition were created with contrasting tempo and articulation. The results showed that eating time was significantly longer in the slow + legato music condition, compared to the fast + staccato music condition. In Experiment 2, we extended the scope of the research question to investigate the relative influence of tempo and articulation, and thus included three additional sound conditions: silence, slow + staccato, and fast + legato music. Overall results revealed a significant main effect of tempo on eating duration as well as an interaction effect between music tempo and articulation. Eating duration was longer with slower tempo, and legato articulation further increased eating time but only when the music had slower tempo. In addition, the presence of music, regardless of style, significantly increased participants’ eating duration compared to eating in silence. Combined, the results from these experiments confirm that music could be employed as a contextual cue to modulate eating speed contributing to healthier eating behaviours such as eating more slowly and consuming less food.},

In {UHT} milks, acetoin and 2-heptanone may mask odor differences leading to indistinguishable odors. No differences were observed regarding perceived odor intensity of pasteurized milks or {UHT} milks differing in fat content.

	abstract = {The increasing trend of integrating robots into the food industry has sparked debates regarding their potential influence on consumer attitudes toward food technology. This study investigated volatile compound profiles via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ({GC}–{MS}), consumer acceptability, sensory profiling, and emotional responses of consumers toward coffee samples brewed by robot and human baristas. Moreover, the effect of the robot experience on food technology neophobia ({FTN}) was investigated. The principal component analysis of the volatile compound profiles revealed that the samples by the robot barista exhibited a higher degree of similarity compared to those prepared by the human barista. The range of relative standard deviations of volatile compounds from the robot barista brewed coffee was 1.4–83.1\% and the variation was smaller than that of the human barista, which was 5.0–118.3\%. Participants had a significant decrease in {FTN} scores after evaluating the robot-brewed coffee (p {\textless} 0.05), but there was no significant difference in {FTN} scores before and after evaluating the coffee brewed by the human barista (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Sensory evaluation studies revealed no significant differences in acceptability ratings and purchase intentions between the two groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05). However, emotional responses to the coffee samples significantly varied, with the robot-brewed coffee inducing more dynamic and positive emotions and the human-brewed coffee inducing more static and positive emotions (p {\textless} 0.05). Overall, this study provides valuable insights into consumer attitudes toward food robot service to humans and indicates that consumer’s experience with food robots may significantly reduce {FTN} (p {\textless} 0.001).},

Selected representative coffees (n = 8) were then evaluated by temporal check all that apply ({TCATA}) with a trained panel to provide additional temporal differentiation and by consumers (n = 125) to determine consumer liking. Key differentiating attributes of cold brew coffees were mouthfeel attributes (viscosity, silkiness, astringency), basic tastes (sour, sour, bitter), and aromatics (overall aroma, smoky, ashy, nutty, beany, caramel/molasses, brothy) (p {\textless} .05). Beverages were also distinguished temporally based on category ({RTD} vs. {BAH} vs. {NBC}) (p {\textless} .05). Drivers of liking for all consumers were cocoa, spicy/resin, and caramel/molasses flavors and sweet taste. Drivers of dislike for all consumers were silky mouthfeel, beany, fruity, and woody/twig flavors and sour taste. The multimodal sensory perceptions generated by cold brew coffees and consumer perception of the cold brew coffees enhances understanding of this expanding beverage category.},

On the basis of quantitative data an aroma model was prepared for the brew.

The higher impact of both methional and the formate on the aroma of the brew and the lower aroma activity of 4-vinylguaiacol were in contrast to results obtained in a previous study for ground coffee of the same provenance and roast degree.},

	shorttitle = {Assessing Game Balance with {AlphaZero}},
	abstract = {It is non-trivial to design engaging and balanced sets of game rules. Modern chess has evolved over centuries, but without a similar recourse to history, the consequences of rule changes to game dynamics are difﬁcult to predict. {AlphaZero} provides an alternative in silico means of game balance assessment. It is a system that can learn near-optimal strategies for any rule set from scratch, without any human supervision, by continually learning from its own experience. In this study we use {AlphaZero} to creatively explore and design new chess variants. There is growing interest in chess variants like Fischer Random Chess, because of classical chess’s voluminous opening theory, the high percentage of draws in professional play, and the non-negligible number of games that end while both players are still in their home preparation. We compare nine other variants that involve atomic changes to the rules of chess. The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while keeping the games close to the original. By learning near-optimal strategies for each variant with {AlphaZero}, we determine what games between strong human players might look like if these variants were adopted. Qualitatively, several variants are very dynamic. An analytic comparison show that pieces are valued differently between variants, and that some variants are more decisive than classical chess. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the rich possibilities that lie beyond the rules of modern chess.},

	abstract = {Coffee “body” is acknowledged by coffee industry professionals to be an attribute which contributes meaningfully to overall coffee quality and is defined as the collective tactile sensation imparted by the beverage. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the chemical compounds that contribute to tactile attributes in coffee. In the present work, coffee body was determined to be comprised of 4 sub-attributes including mouthcoating, astringency, chalkiness, and thickness and the specific constituents contributing to the tactile sensation of mouthcoating were further pursued using sensory-guided fractionation via preparative-scale liquid chromatography. Signal detection-based sensory methodologies were employed to characterize the sensory effects elicited by selected compounds in water and coffee matrices. Two chlorogenic acids, 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3-{CQA}) and 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (4-{CQA}), were observed to impart subtle but significantly perceptible mouthcoating effects in water and/or coffee. Counterintuitively, sensory perception was inversely related to compound concentration. Complex receptor-ligand interactions or salivary lubrication dynamics are discussed as two potential mechanisms to explain this inverse relationship. Taken together, the outcomes of the present study (1) provide new targets for coffee tactile sensation optimization and modulation, (2) identify a novel dimension of sensory impact for two compounds of the chlorogenic acid family, and (3) present a need for deeper investigation into 3CQA and 4-{CQA} mechanisms of sensation.},

	abstract = {Excessive sugar-sweetened beverage ({SSB}) consumption has been associated with overweight and obesity. Caffeine is a common additive to {SSB}, and through dependence effects, it has the potential to promote the consumption of caffeine-containing foods. The objective of the present study was to assess the inﬂuence that caffeine has on the consumption of {SSB}. Participants (n 99) were blindly assigned to either a caffeinated {SSB} (C-{SSB}) or a non-caffeinated {SSB} ({NC}-{SSB}) group. Following randomisation, all participants completed a 9 d ﬂavour-conditioning paradigm. They then completed a 28 d ad libitum intake intervention where they consumed as much or as little of C-{SSB} or {NC}-{SSB} as desired. The amount consumed (ml) was recorded daily, 4 d diet diaries were collected and liking of {SSB} was assessed at the start and end of the intervention. Participants (n 50) consuming the C-{SSB} had a daily {SSB} intake of 419 ({SD} 298) ml (785 ({SD} 559) {kJ}/d) over the 28 d intervention, signiﬁcantly more than participants (n 49) consuming the {NC}-{SSB} (273 ({SD} 278) ml/d, 512 ({SD} 521) {kJ}/d) (P,0·001). A trained ﬂavour panel (n 30) found no difference in ﬂavour between the C-{SSB} and {NC}-{SSB} (P. 0·05). However, participants who consumed the C-{SSB} liked the {SSB} more than those who consumed the {NC}-{SSB} (6·3 v. 6·0 on a nine-point hedonic scale, P¼ 0·022). The addition of low concentrations of caffeine to the {SSB} signiﬁcantly increases the consumption of the {SSB}. Regulating caffeine as a food additive may be an effective strategy to decrease the consumption of nutrient-poor high-energy foods and beverages.},

This study aims to determine the effects of fat and coffee concentration on sensory attributes and consumer liking of iced-coffee beverages. Nine iced-coffee beverages were formulated: low fat–low coffee; medium fat–low coffee; high fat–low coffee; low fat–medium coffee; medium fat–medium coffee; high fat–medium coffee; low fat–high coffee; medium fat–high coffee; and high fat–high coffee. Fat content was adjusted using different concentrations of cream, and coffee using different concentrations of Nescafé Blend 43. Regular coffee consumers (n = 231) rated their overall liking using a 9-point hedonic scale and completed a ranked preference based on degree of liking of all samples. Consumers also rated liking for sensory attributes: appearance, aroma, sweetness, coffee intensity, mouthfeel, and aftertaste. There were significant relationships between 1/ fat and 2/ coffee and liking of iced-coffee beverages (p {\textless} 0.001). There were three clusters of consumers based on iced-coffee preferences. Response surface curve indicated that overall liking of iced-coffee beverages increased with the increase of fat and coffee concentration to a certain level, then continuing to increase the fat and coffee concentration decreases overall liking. The finding of this study provides valuable information on how fat and coffee concentrations can be adjusted to modify consumer acceptance of iced-coffee beverages.},

Six Spanish wines, two from Chardonnay and four from Tempranillo grapes, all of them showing different chemical and sensory characteristics, were selected. Wines were separated into volatile and non-volatile fractions by solid phase extraction and lyophilisation and further liquid extraction, respectively. Eighteen ‘‘reconstituted wines” were prepared, combining different volatile extracts and different non-volatile matrices and adjusting ethanol content to 12\% (v/v), and were further described by a speciﬁcally trained sensory panel. Taste attributes (sweetness, acidity, bitterness), astringency, aroma intensity, global intensity and persistence were assessed in both, original and ‘‘reconstituted” wines by using a numerical category scale. The sensory properties of the original wines were retained by their corresponding ‘‘reconstituted samples”. The sensory assessment of the ‘‘reconstituted wines” showed that the addition of volatile fruity extracts from white wines brought about a decrease in astringency and bitterness and an increase in sweet perception in all cases. While global intensity and persistence of white wine matrices were also increased, they did not change in red wine matrices, which suggests that the volatile fraction plays only a secondary role in these attributes of red wines. Similarly, the effects of replacing the volatile fraction of a red wine by volatile extracts from other red wines were small and inconsistent, which conﬁrms that taste and astringency are primarily driven by non-volatile molecules in these wines.},

Quality perceived by wine experts was investigated under the assumption that this construct is built from multimodal sensory inputs. Twenty-one wine experts from Rioja (Spain) scored the intrinsic quality of 16 Spanish red wines under four conditions: (i) visual stimulation only, (ii) orthonasal olfaction alone, (iii) in-mouth sensations only (wearing a nose clip) and (iv) global tasting. Agreement among judges and the effect of evaluation condition were evaluated by principal component analysis ({PCA}) and {ANOVA}, respectively. In parallel, a trained panel described aroma, taste and in-mouth sensory properties such as astringency, global intensity and persistence. {CIELab} colour coordinates were also obtained. These descriptive data were submitted to regression analyses to explore their relationship with quality scores derived from the four evaluation conditions. Common mental representations of wine quality under visual, olfactory and global conditions were conﬁrmed, while there was not a clear quality construct based exclusively on taste and mouthfeel properties. Wine taste and mouth-feel quality concept is suggested to be built only in combination with aroma and/or colour stimuli, and thus within a wine context.},

	abstract = {Introduction When participants eat foods, they direct their attention to the particular taste quality that is the target of evaluation and subsequently perceive the intensity of the attended taste quality. We defined the ease with which participants pay attention to a particular taste quality as the Bnoticeability{\textasciicircum} of that quality. In our previous study, Japanese participants evaluated noticeability and intensity of five fundamental taste qualities (sweetness, umami, saltiness, sourness, and bitterness) under open- and closednostril conditions, using a popular traditional Japanese confection, yokan. The correlation between noticeability and intensity of sweetness was significantly reduced when participants were tested with open nostrils. Therefore, we hypothesized that high familiarity with a food and its olfactory information is necessary to decrease the correlation between these two scales.
Methods In order to verify this hypothesis, we asked Japanese and German participants, who have different food cultures, to subjectively evaluate yokan, which is familiar to Japanese but unfamiliar to Germans. In a control condition, marshmallows were used which are familiar to all participants. Participants consumed each food under open- and closed-nostril conditions and evaluated the noticeability and intensity of the five fundamental taste qualities.
Results There were significant differences between the participants’ groups as the correlation between noticeability and intensity was reduced significantly only for sweetness of a familiar food under open-nostril condition.
Conclusions These results support our hypothesis that high familiarity with a food and its olfactory information might be necessary to decrease the correlation between noticeability and intensity of a particular taste quality. Implications This finding suggests that perception of a food is influenced by its familiarity and retronasal aroma. These results suggest when a food is unfamiliar, the noticeability and intensity of a particular taste quality are not much altered by the retronasal aroma, but when a food is highly familiar, retronasal aroma serves to decouple noticeability and intensity of a given taste quality.},

Sweet apple juice and salty green-pea soup were spiked with either vanillin or bacon odorants to produce {OITE}. In the {VAS} experiment, saltiness, sweetness, sourness, bitterness and the global aroma intensities were evaluated for each base with and without the odorants. The ranking task consisted in ranking from the lowest to the highest sweetness/saltiness intensities, three references with increasing tastant concentration and a target solution with the lowest tastant concentration and the odorant. {VAS} highlighted {OITE} neither in the apple juice nor in the green-pea soup, in no group. The ranking method revealed an {OITE} in the green-pea soup in both groups, and only the group with obesity experienced {OITE} in the apple juice.},

In this study, the effect of vanilla and chocolate ﬂavorings on the sensory attributes of Reb-A and Reb-M applied to soymilk and milk was investigated to identify whether the addition of ﬂavoring could enhance the sweetness via aroma–taste interactions.
{RESULTS}: Nine samples each of soymilk and milk were formulated by adding sucrose, Reb-A and Reb-M in three ﬂavor conditions (no ﬂavoring, vanilla, and chocolate). Descriptive analyses were conducted using nine panelists for the soymilk and eight panelists for the milk. Another descriptive analysis was conducted using the same samples with olfactory occlusion via the wearing of a nose clip to check whether the sweetness enhancement was due to olfactory input. The chocolate ﬂavoring significantly enhanced the sweetness of Reb-A and Reb-M and reduced the bitterness, bitter aftertaste and astringency in both soymilk and milk. The vanilla ﬂavoring was not as effective as the chocolate ﬂavoring in enhancing sweetness. When the olfactory passage was closed with a nose clip, the sweetness enhancement and bitterness suppression were not detected in the samples.
{CONCLUSION}: The addition of chocolate ﬂavoring could successfully improve the sensory proﬁle of soymilk sweetened with Reb-A through aroma–taste interactions.},

These products are sweet candies which have either pleasant (e.g., coconut) or unpleasant (e.g., sour milk) aromas. In the first test, all participants rated candies with their nose open. In the second test, all participants rated candies with nose closed immediately followed by nose open. Both experiments demonstrated that sweetness was rated higher for good beans than bad beans and bitterness was rated higher for bad beans than good beans when rated with nose open. Closing the nose eliminated this difference, as all beans were actually sweet and not bitter.},

Nevertheless, selecting odor descriptors with a given associated taste remains a challenge. In the aim to look for odors able to enhance some speciﬁc taste, we tested diﬀerent multivariate analyses to ﬁnd links between taste descriptors and odor descriptors, starting from a set of data previously obtained using gas chromatography/olfactometry-associated taste: 68 odorant zones described with 41 odor descriptors and 4 taste-associated descriptors (sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, and sourness). A partial least square analysis allowed for identiﬁcation of odors associated with a speciﬁc taste. For instance, odors described as either fruity, sweet, strawberry, candy, ﬂoral, or orange are associated with sweetness, while odors described as either toasted, potato, sulfur, or mushroom are associated with saltiness. A network representation allowed for visualization of the links between odor and taste descriptors. As an example, a positive association was found between butter odor and both saltiness and sweetness. Our approach provided a visualization tool of the links between odor and taste description and could be used to select odor-active molecules with a potential taste enhancement eﬀect based on their odor descriptors.},

Untreated controls/ comparison groups not receiving extension traction showed no increase in cervical lordosis. Several trials demon strated that both traction and comparison treatment groups experienced immediate pain relief. Traction treatment groups maintained their pain and disability improvements up to 1.5 years later. Comparative groups not receiving lordosis improvement experienced regression of symptoms towards pre-treatment values by 1 years’ follow-up. [Conclusion] There are several high-quality controlled clinical trials substantiating that increasing cervical lordosis by extension traction as part of a spinal rehabilitation program reduces pain and disability and improves functional measures, and that these improvements are maintained long-term. Comparative groups who receive multimodal rehabilitation but not extension traction experience temporary relief that regresses after treatment cessation.},

	abstract = {Background. Manual therapy ({MT}) and exercise have been extensively used to treat people with musculoskeletal conditions such as temporomandibular disorders ({TMD}). The evidence regarding their effectiveness provided by early systematic reviews is outdated.
Purpose. The aim of this study was to summarize evidence from and evaluate the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of {MT} and therapeutic exercise interventions compared with other active interventions or standard care for treatment of {TMD}. Data Sources. Electronic data searches of 6 databases were performed, in addition to a manual search. Study Selection. Randomized controlled trials involving adults with {TMD} that compared any type of {MT} intervention (eg, mobilization, manipulation) or exercise therapy with a placebo intervention, controlled comparison intervention, or standard care were included. The main outcomes of this systematic review were pain, range of motion, and oral function. Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Data Extraction. Data were extracted in duplicate on speciﬁc study characteristics. Data Synthesis. The overall evidence for this systematic review was considered low. The trials included in this review had unclear or high risk of bias. Thus, the evidence was generally downgraded based on assessments of risk of bias. Most of the effect sizes were low to moderate, with no clear indication of superiority of exercises versus other conservative treatments for {TMD}. However, {MT} alone or in combination with exercises at the jaw or cervical level showed promising effects. Limitations. Quality of the evidence and heterogeneity of the studies were limitations of the study.
Conclusions. No high-quality evidence was found, indicating that there is great uncertainty about the effectiveness of exercise and {MT} for treatment of {TMD}.},

A microbiome “imbalance” or dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) is linked to inflammation. Here, we aim to define the impact of specific foods on bacterial species commonly depleted in patients with {IBD} to better inform dietary treatment. We performed a single-arm, prepost intervention trial. After a baseline period, a dietary intervention with the {IBD}-{AntiInflammatory} Diet ({IBD}-{AID}) was initiated. We collected stool and blood samples and assessed dietary intake throughout the study. We applied advanced computational approaches to define and model complex interactions between the foods reported and the microbiome. A dense dataset comprising 553 dietary records and 340 stool samples was obtained from 22 participants. Consumption of prebiotics, probiotics, and beneficial foods correlated with increased abundance of Clostridia and Bacteroides, commonly depleted in {IBD} cohorts. We further show that specific foods categorized as prebiotics or adverse foods are correlated to levels of cytokines in serum (i.e., {GM}-{CSF}, {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {TNF}-alpha) that play a central role in {IBD} pathogenesis. By using robust predictive analytics, this study represents the first steps to detangle diet-microbiome and diet-immune interactions to inform personalized nutrition for patients suffering from dysbiosis-related {IBD}.},

Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in which animals were colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced commensal bacteria, we elucidated the functional interactions between dietary ﬁber, the gut microbiota, and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defense against enteric pathogens. We show that during chronic or intermittent dietary ﬁber deﬁciency, the gut microbiota resorts to host-secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier. Dietary ﬁber deprivation, together with a ﬁber-deprived, mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and lethal colitis by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Our work reveals intricate pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics.},

This aspect is reflected in published guidelines for {IBD} management, which previously placed diet as only a minor factor, but now have diet-specific publications. This Review describes a four-step approach in a dietitian’s assessment and management of diet in patients with {IBD}: (1) identifying and correcting nutritional gaps and dietary imbalances; (2) considering diet to treat active disease with the use of exclusive enteral nutrition ({EEN}) or emerging diets that could replace {EEN}; (3) using therapeutic diets to control existing complications of {IBD}, such as reduced fibre to prevent bowel obstruction in stricturing disease or a fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet to manage co-existing functional gut symptoms; and (4) considering the role of diet in preventing {IBD} development in high-risk populations.},

Methods: In this open-labeled randomized controlled trial, 90 {UC} patients were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups for 12 weeks: grounded ﬂaxseed ({GF}; 30 g/day), ﬂaxseed oil ({FO}; 10 g/day) and control group. The weight, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum inﬂammatory markers (interleukin-6 ({IL}-6), interferon gamma ({INF}-γ), transforming growth factor beta ({TGF}-β), and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ({ESR})), and fecal calprotectin were measured at the baseline and end of the study.
Results: Totally, 75 patients (43 men and 32 women) with a mean age of 31.54 ± 9.84 years participated in the present study. Comparing the change of the variables indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in fecal calprotectin (P {\textless} 0.001), Mayo score (P {\textless} 0.001), {ESR} (P {\textless} 0.001), {INF}-γ (P {\textless} 0.001), {IL}-6 (P {\textless} 0.001), waist circumference (P = 0.02), Diastolic Blood Pressure ({DBP}) (P {\textless} 0.001), and Systolic Blood Pressure ({SBP}) (P {\textless} 0.001) and a signiﬁcant increase in {TGF}-β (P {\textless} 0.001) and Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease {QuestionnaireShort} form ({IBDQ}-9) score (P {\textless} 0.001) in the {GF} and {FO} groups compared to the control.

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological Relevance
              . Natural products, like Flaxseed (
              Linum usitatissimum
              ), have traditionally been used in inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}). It is known to contain multiple constituents which may account for its effectiveness, as {IBD} is a multifaceted disease.
              Aim of the Study
              . In the current study, we aimed to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in {IBD}.
              Materials and Methods
              . Aqueous‐methanolic crude extracts of Flaxseed (Fs.Cr) and Flaxseed oil were tested against 6\% acetic acid‐ ({AA}‐) induced colitis in {BALB}/c mice. Microscopic damage parameters of the hematoxylin and eosin‐stained and periodic acid‐Schiff‐alcian blue‐stained sections of the colon were scored to be assessed. Possible antispasmodic mechanism was studied on isolated rabbit jejunum, while antibacterial activity was assessed
              in vitro
              for microbes implicated in {IBD}.
              Results
              . In {AA}‐induced colitis, Flaxseed oil was found to be more effective in reducing mortality and colonic ulcers than Fs.Cr at 500 mg/kg dose. Fs.Cr was more efficacious in increasing mucin content as compared to oil, exhibiting slightly greater anti‐inflammatory effect (50\% vs 35\%) and reducing depth of lesion (55\% vs 42.31\%, respectively). Antispasmodic activity of Fs.Cr (0.03 and 0.1 mg/ml) was mediated by phosphodiesterase inhibitors ({PDEI}, possibly {PDE}‐4 subtype) with a resultant increase in {cAMP} levels. Flaxseed oil {PDEI} activity was mild (1 and 3 mg/ml). Fs.Cr (0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml) was potent in exhibiting anticholinergic activity, similar to dicyclomine, whereas Flaxseed oil showed anticholinergic effect at 1 and 3 mg/ml. Flaxseed oil (9 and 14 
              µ
              g/ml) was bactericidal against enteropathogenic
              E.coli
              ({EPEC}), enterotoxigenic
              E.coli
              ({ETEC}), and enteroaggregative
              E.coli
              ({EAEC}), whereas Fs.Cr exhibited bactericidal effect against {EPEC} at 100 
              µ
              g/ml.
              Conclusions
              . Results of this study, taken together with previous studies, suggest that Flaxseed possesses anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, and antispasmodic action through multiple pathways and thus offers promising potential to be developed for {IBD}.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean diet pattern is increasingly associated with improved metabolic health. Two mechanisms by which consuming a Mediterranean diet pattern may contribute to improved metabolic health are modulation of the gastrointestinal ({GI}) microbiota and reduction of metabolic endotoxemia. Metabolic endotoxemia, deﬁned as a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of bacterial endotoxin, has been proposed as a cause of inﬂammation during metabolic dysfunction. As the largest source of endotoxins in the human body, the {GI} microbiota represents a crucial area for research on strategies for reducing endotoxemia. Diets high in saturated fat and low in ﬁber contribute to metabolic endotoxemia through several mechanisms, including changes in the {GI} microbiome and bacterial fermentation end products, intestinal physiology and barrier function, and enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Thus, the Mediterranean diet pattern, rich in unsaturated fats and ﬁber, may be one dietary strategy to reduce metabolic endotoxemia. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the diﬀerential eﬀects of dietary saturated and unsaturated fats on the microbiota and metabolic health, but human studies are lacking. The role of dietary ﬁber and the {GI} microbiome in metabolic endotoxemia is underinvestigated. Clinical research on the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of dietary fat and ﬁber on the {GI} microbiota and {GI} and systemic inﬂammation is necessary to determine eﬃcacious dietary strategies for reducing metabolic endotoxemia, inﬂammation, and subsequent metabolic disease.

This study aimed to evaluate the role of carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of {UC}.
Methods: Comprehensive search in {PubMed} and Embase was conducted to identify all relevant studies, and the role of carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of {UC} was quantitatively assessed by dose-response meta-analysis.
Results: Nine studies (5 case-control and 4 prospective cohort) were identiﬁed with a total of 975 {UC} cases and 239352 controls. The summary relative risks ({RR}) for per 10 g increment/day were 1.005 (95\% {CI}: 0.991e1.019, I2 ¼ 31.5\%, n ¼ 5) for total carbohydrate intake, 1.001 (95\%{CI}: 0.971e1.032, I2 ¼ 0.0\%, n ¼ 7) for the subtype of ﬁber intake, 1.029 (95\%{CI}: 0.962e1.101, I2 ¼ 68.9\%, n ¼ 2) for the subtype of sugar intake, and 1.010 (95\%{CI}: 0.975e1.047, I2 ¼ 12.4\%, n ¼ 7) for total protein intake. Among sugar subtypes, only sucrose intake was found positively related with {UC} risk ({RR} for per 10 g increment/day: 1.098, 95\%{CI}: 1.024e1.177, I2 ¼ 0.0\%, n ¼ 3). No evidence of a non-linear dose-response association was found between the nutrient intake and {UC} risk, except for the subtype of sucrose (P for non-linear trend ¼ 0.032). Subgroup analyses showed consistent results.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested a lack of association between dietary carbohydrate or protein intake and the risk of {UC}, except for the subtype of sucrose which played a signiﬁcant role in the development of {UC}. Large-scale prospective designed studies are needed to conﬁrm our ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}: Chronic inﬂammatory bowel diseases ({IBDs}) have been associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. Although dietary ﬁber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited information on the role of ﬁber on {IBD} activity. We investigated factors associated with ﬁber consumption and whether it was associated with ﬂares in patients with {IBD}.
{METHODS}: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 1619 participants in the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America Partners Internet cohort (Crohn’s disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis, 489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease ﬂare at 6 months was deﬁned as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff values, and/or an {IBDrelated} surgical procedure or hospitalization since baseline.
{RESULTS}: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of surgery, and past {IBD} hospitalization ate less ﬁber. The risks for disease ﬂare differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of ﬁber consumption, participants with Crohn’s disease in the highest quartile were less likely to have a ﬂare (adjusted odds ratios [{OR}], 0.58; 95\% conﬁdence interval [{CI}], 0.37–0.90). Participants with Crohn’s disease who reported that they did not avoid high-ﬁber foods were w40\% less likely to have a disease ﬂare than those who avoided highﬁber foods (adjusted {OR}, 0.59; 95\% {CI}, 0.43–0.81). There was no association between ﬁber intake and ﬂares in patients with ulcerative colitis (adjusted {OR}, 1.82; 95\% {CI}, 0.92–3.60).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Intake of dietary ﬁber is associated with reduced disease ﬂares in patients with Crohn’s disease, but not {UC}. Recommendations to limit dietary ﬁber should be re-evaluated.},

The main pathological features of {AD} include the widespread deposition of amyloid-beta and neuroﬁbrillary tangles in the brain. So far, the pathogenesis of {AD} remains elusive, and no radical treatment has been developed. In recent years, mounting evidence has shown that there is a bidirectional interaction between the gut and brain, known as the brain–gut axis, and that the intestinal microbiota are closely related to the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will summarize the laboratory and clinical evidence of the correlation between intestinal ﬂora and {AD}, discuss its possible role in the pathogenesis, and prospect its applications in the diagnosis and treatment of {AD}.},

Older as well as more recent studies show beneﬁcial effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inﬂammatory bowel diseases ({IBD}), such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the beneﬁts of prebiotics in rodent {IBD} models and in {IBD} patients and discuss their possible protective mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic intestinal inﬂammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinﬂammatory immune response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes the composition of the intestinal microﬂora toward more protective intestinal bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy for {IBD} targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging. Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human {IBD} will need to be conﬁrmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.},

Our aim was to investigate the protective effects of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an abundant member of this genus, in different rodent models of {IBD}.
Methods: We assessed the effect of B. thetaiotaomicron administration on primary readouts of colitis (weight loss, histopathology, and immune parameters) in dextran sodium sulphate ({DSS}) and interleukin-10 knockout ({IL}10KO) models of {IBD}. Efficacy of a freeze-dried bacterial formulation and a purified recombinant protein of B. thetaiotaomicron was also investigated.
Results: B. thetaiotaomicron showed protective effects in both {DSS} and {IL}10KO rodent models, as demonstrated by significant amelioration of weight loss, colon shortening, histopathological damage and immune activation. This efficacy was not exclusive to actively growing bacterial preparations but was retained by freeze-dried cells of B. thetaiotaomicron. A pirin-like protein ({PLP}) of B. thetaiotaomicron, identified by microarray analysis during coculture of the bacterial strain with Caco-2 cells, reduced pro-inflammatory {NF}-κB signalling in these intestinal epithelial cells. Recombinant {PLP} partially recapitulated the effect of the whole strain in a rat {DSS} model.
Conclusions: B. thetaiotaomicron displays strong efficacy in preclinical models of {IBD} and protects against weight loss, histopathological changes in the colon and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that the live strain or its products may be a novel alternative to current treatment options for Crohn’s disease.},

Beyond these two dietary interventions, symptomatic benefit in {IBD} has also been shown from a gluten-free diet [{GFD}] and paleolithic diet [{PALEO}], among others.These nutritional therapies may point to critical factors in not only the pathology, but also the pathogenesis of the disease group. It is difficult, however, to discern a common element within the large number of diet-based causation theories [e.g. emulsifiers, processed foods, refrigeration, increased total fat intake, low fibre intake, carbohydrate dominant food, etc.] and the varied dietary treatments of {IBD}. This Viewpoint article highlights that carbohydrate variation links diet-based causation theories, and that carbohydrate monotony or persistence is the commonly shared characteristic of diet-based {IBD} therapy.

For this review article, we performed a review of articles in {PubMed} through February 1, 2017, by using the following Medical Subject Heading terms: crohns disease, crohn’s disease, crohn disease, inﬂammatory bowel disease, and inﬂammatory bowel diseases. Presenting symptoms are often variable and may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and in certain cases fevers or chills. There are 3 main disease phenotypes: inﬂammatory, structuring, and penetrating. In addition to the underlying disease phenotype, up to a third of patients will develop perianal involvement of their disease. In addition, in some cases, extraintestinal manifestations may develop. The diagnosis is typically made with endoscopic and/or radiologic ﬁndings. Disease management is usually with pharmacologic therapy, which is determined on the basis of disease severity and underlying disease phenotype. Although the goal of management is to control the inﬂammation and induce a clinical remission with pharmacologic therapy, most patients will eventually require surgery for their disease. Unfortunately, surgery is not curative and patients still require ongoing therapy even after surgery for disease recurrence. Importantly, given the risks of complications from both Crohn disease and the medications used to treat the disease process, primary care physicians play an important role in optimizing the preventative care management to reduce the risk of complications.},

The ethyl-bridged ﬂavanols (with mean dp of 5) were rated signiﬁcantly more bitter than both the apple procyanidin fractions. Astringency of the ethyl-bridged ﬂavanols was lesser than the apple procyanidin fraction with dp9 and more than that with dp3. Highly puriﬁed grape anthocyanidin monoglucosides and monoglucoside coumarates, prepared either by solid-phase extraction or by multi layer coil counter-current chromatography were rated similarly to the {MW} indicating that free anthocyanins, like the coloured tannin-like polyphenolic compounds from wine and pomace, do not contribute astringency nor bitterness to wine.},

In another experiment, panellists tasted solutions of 5\% sucrose mixed with 312 p.p.m. maltol. Tastings were performed with and without the panellists wearing nose-clips. The smell of the maltol did not confuse trained panellists into believing that the mixture of sucrose and maltol tasted sweeter than sucrose alone. However, in another experiment when both smell and taste were assessed, untrained panellists found that a sucrose-maltol solution possessed an overall greater sweetness than an equivalent concentration of sucrose. That is, if panellists concentrate only on taste then maltol does not appear to enhance sweetness whereas if od our and smell are assessed then maltol was found to elevate total sweetness intensity. Triangle tests were performed to determine whether lemonade drinks containing 15 p.p.m. maltol were perceptually different from the original lemonade drink containing no maltol. No significant difference was found between the two lemonades and it was concluded that the addition of a sub-threshold concentration of maltol did not significantly affect the taste of lemonade drinks.},

Response alternatives set a context that inﬂuences an observer’s approach to an evaluation task prior to the presentation of the stimuli. Observers develop a strategy for dealing with the task, and the number and type of response alternatives represent constraints that the experimenter imposes on the observer. Studies of odor-induced enhancement of taste ratings and taste mixtures provide support for this view.

	abstract = {We assessed the influence of different odors on detection of a sweet tastant, and the ability of imagined odors to elicit the same effects as perceived odors on taste perception. The tastant used was sucrose, and the two odorants were strawberry and ham. In the first experiment, participants either smelled or imagined one of two odors during taste detection tasks (between-subject design), whereas in the second one, subjects completed both the odor imagery and perception conditions with taste detection tasks (within-subject design). The effect was odorant-specific: detection of sucrose was significantly better when subjects smelled strawberry than when they smelled ham. Furthermore, imagined odors influenced taste perception in the same way as did perceived odors. We concluded that the odor-specific effect on taste perception is an authentic perceptual phenomenon. Our results also support the notion that odor-induced changes in taste perception are mediated centrally. Finally, our findings are in agreement with reports supporting the existence of odor imagery.},

The present study evaluated the sweetness-inhibiting effects of G.sylvestre extracts on three concentrations each of acesulfamc K, aspartame, sodium cyclamate, fructose, glucose, sucrose, stevioside and xylitol. Subjects made sweetness judgements of the stimuli following pretreatment with either distilled water, commercial tea or G.sylvestre extracts. Gymnema sylvestre pretrcatment reduced the sweetness of the stimuli by an average of 77\% with no evidence for a differentia] effect across sweeteners. The percentage reduction in sweetness was constant across the low, medium and high concentrations of the sweeteners. Kinetic plots of the data fit the Michelis-Menten model for non-competitive inhibition, but statistical results did not permit competitive or uncompetitive mechanisms to be ruled out. A receptor occupancy/blocking mechanism is unlikely The results support disruption of a more general aspect of sweetness transduction and fit a type of 'mixed' inhibition involving an effect on the breakdown of the stimulus/ receptor complex. Inhibition of a later step in a sequential-step transduction system and/or a change in the physicochemistry of the environment of the stimulus/receptor complex are possible.},

	abstract = {The present study investigated the role that congruency between tastes and odors plays in two types of taste–odor interactions: retronasal odor enhancement by taste and retronasal odor referral to the mouth. In the ﬁrst experiment, subjects rated (1) the intensities of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and speciﬁc odor of aqueous samples of 3 tastants (sucrose, citric acid, caffeine) and 2 odorants (citral, coffee odor), both alone and in taste–odor mixtures, and (2) the degree of congruency of all possible taste–odor pairs. The results showed that only sucrose signiﬁcantly enhanced the perceived intensities of citrus and coffee odors (Tukey’s test, p {\textless} 0.05), while citric acid and caffeine failed to enhance or even suppressed the odors. In the second experiment, the returning subjects were asked (1) to report the perceived locations of the odors after inhaling 3 odorants (citral, ‘‘sweet’’ and ‘‘bitter’’ coffee odors) through the mouth alone or in the presence of either water or various tastes in the mouth, and (2) to rate the degree of congruency between tastes and odors. The data showed that a highly congruent taste or taste mixture signiﬁcantly increased localization of odors to the mouth (v2, p {\textless} 0.05). These ﬁndings suggest that taste–odor congruency is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for retronasal odor enhancement. In contrast, taste–odor congruency is a critical component for retronasal odor referral, and the degree of congruency modulates the degree of odor referral to the mouth. The results and implications of the study ﬁndings are discussed in terms of cognitive and perceptual factors of ﬂavor perception.},

Lactone aroma changes had little effect on salty taste perception, but significantly inhibited sourness perception at high aroma levels. The results of this study further enhance our understanding of the role of lactone aroma in interactive perception, and provide a theoretical basis for improving the flavour quality of Cheddar products.},

	abstract = {Odour-modulation of taste perception refers to the ﬁnding that adding a tasteless odorant can change a taste’s attributes. An extensively studied example is sweetness enhancement, whereby adding an odorant such as caramel makes a sucrose solution taste sweeter. Experiment 1 tested whether chefs would display odour-modulation to the same extent as controls. When asked to rate sucrose and citric acid solutions that contained an odorant, caramel or citral, or no odorant, participants showed sweetness enhancement and sourness suppression by caramel. Citral produced sourness enhancement of sucrose – a new ﬁnding – but, paradoxically, when added to citric acid it decreased sourness ratings and increased sweetness ratings. The only difference detected between chefs and controls was in the way that citral affected sourness ratings of sucrose solutions. Experiment 2 tested participants without professional culinary experience on their food/drink associations to caramel and citral. The results showed that, while the associations evoked by caramel were almost always sweet foods or drinks, associations to citral varied widely in terms of sweetness and sourness. The latter suggests an explanation for the mixed pattern of results obtained for citral in Experiment 1.},

The data from such a sequence of experiments contain information on the relative biases and variability of individual assessors, and on any temporal inﬂuences on the experiments. This information can be extracted by extending models for individual experiments to encompass variation between them. Because each assessor takes part in several experiments, adjustment can be made for the absence of individuals from some of them. By including future experiments in the extended models, it is also possible to use information on assessors’ previous performance to reduce the average variance of product diﬀerences in future. Such a combination of information over experiments is illustrated using a sequence of 45 apple-tasting experiments conducted with the main aim of monitoring assessor performance over time. Models with multiplicative interaction terms have been used for modelling heterogeneous interaction between assessors and products in individual sensory experiments. Under the assumption that the data are normally distributed (or can be suitably transformed) we extend such models to analyse data from sequences of experiments. A Bayesian approach is used because of the complexity of the extended model and the need to incorporate future experiments.},

Two naturally occurring sugars; glucose and fructose, and two organic acids; citric and lactic acid, were studied using D-optimal design spaces created using experimental design software (Design Exp). Perception was studied using the scaling technique of magnitude estimation by a panel of trained assessors. Alterations in aroma volatile release proﬁles and viscosity were measured instrumentally using {APCI}-{MS} and rheometry, respectively. Aroma release proﬁles were unaﬀected by varying tastant levels and only the highest level of glucose (150 g/l) resulted in a small increase in viscosity. However, ﬂavour perception was increased on addition of tastants, although, interestingly, glucose showed a diﬀerent proﬁle to fructose despite equi-sweet levels being used. This data provides evidence for taste–aroma interactions within this citrus ﬂavoured system which are not due to physico-chemical interactions within the beverage matrix. This study has also uncovered apparent diﬀerences between eﬀects of fructose and glucose on ﬂavour perception, again not due to alterations in physical factors, and raises the intriguing possibility of diﬀerent receptors/receptor mechanisms between the two monosaccharides.},

	abstract = {The performance of three diﬀerent discrimination tests (A–Not A, 2-{AFC}, same–diﬀerent) was investigated to explore the eﬀects of varying aspects of the test protocols, such as the familiarization procedure and retasting of the reference (A), during testing on discriminability and the cognitive decision strategy used in the tests, when discriminating between the two diﬀerent margarines. Seven judges, who were not familiar with margarine products, each gave 24 ratings for each of six protocols, resulting in 168 ratings in the pooled data, and from which R-indices and d0 estimates were calculated. When both test products were presented beforehand for familiarization, judges adopted the beta cognitive decision strategy. When only the reference (A) was presented to the judges beforehand for familiarization, and the reference (A) was retasted before the test product either by prescription or at will, the tau cognitive decision strategy was adopted. When the number of samples tasted within a test increased, discriminability was considerably decreased. Such diﬀerences between test protocols were explained in terms of the concept formation of the test products, carry-over and fatigue eﬀects, and memory problems caused by longer time-intervals between tastings.},

At these concentrations, a larger range in sourness intensity than in sweetness was produced, resulting in greater suppression of sweetness by increasing acid levels than of sourness by increasing sweetener levels. Although aspartame samples had a longer duration of sweetness and fruitiness, sucrose and aspartame did not interact differently with the sourness of citric acid. Fruitiness intensity and duration was enhanced by both sweetness and sourness, but to a greater extent by sourness. Whether this enhancement is attributable to a cognitive association of sweetness or sourness with fruitiness or is due to the inability of die subjects to separate sweet and sour tastes from orally perceived fruity flavor cannot be concluded from this study.},

Four levels each of sucrose and citric acid were combined factorially and dissolved in the low-acid juice, providing sixteen stimulus combinations. Using graphic-rating scales, assessors evaluated the stimuli for intensities of overall flavour, sweetness, and acidity; the relation of each of these intensities to ideal; and general acceptability. The various acceptability responses proved to be internally consistent, and the experiment suggested an optimum sugar-acid blend from the sixteen combinations. Ratings of overall flavour strength followed a compressed pattern in a factorial plot, with increasing concentrations of sugar and acid exerting a diminishingly small effect. In the perception of individual components, sucrose clearly suppressed the perceived intensity of citric acid, but only the highest concentration of acid unequivocally suppressed sweetness. There was a striking similarity between each set of intensity responses and the corresponding ideal-relative responses, suggesting a link between intensity and hedonics.},

            The effects of grinding (medium-coarse) and extraction time (14–22 h) on the physicochemical and sensorial properties of cold brew coffee produced using two types of Colombian specialty coffees (Huila and Nariño) were evaluated. Cold coffee brewed under coarse grinding and 22 h of extraction exhibited the highest values of total dissolved solids, extraction yield, {pH}, titratable acidity ({TA}), and total phenolic content. The type of coffee used mainly affected the {TA} and {pH}. All cold brew coffee samples had lower {TA} values than their hot counterparts. Nariño cold brew samples had higher {TA} values than those of Huila in all treatments evaluated. Higher scores were reported in the sensorial evaluation of cold brew coffee when prepared using the shortest time (14 h) and coarse grinding for both coffee types. These coffees were characterized by strong sweetness, fruity and floral flavours, medium bitterness and acidity, and a creamy body. Furans, pyrazines, ketones, aldehydes, pyrroles, esters, lactones, furanones, and phenols were detected as odour-active compounds. The findings of this study demonstrate that the particle size, contact time, and coffee type affect the physicochemical and sensorial characteristics of cold brew coffee, leading to cold brew coffees with different flavour profiles.},

A number of fruit aromas/volatiles appear to offer a promising route to enhancing the perception of sweetness without adding to the calorific load. However, while a growing body of empirical evidence suggests that this is a promising strategy, as made clear by this narrative review, there are a number of outstanding questions that have yet to be answered in terms of optimising the impact on sweetness offered by the addition of volatile aromas. It is, for example, currently unclear what the maximum sweetness enhancement effect that can be achieved by combining a variety of different volatiles (e.g., those associated with different fruits) before a ceiling or saturation effect is reached. It is also currently unclear how important conscious awareness of the specific volatiles, or aromas, are to odourinduced taste enhancement ({OITE}) effects. A third outstanding issue concerns whether {OITE} would occur in the case of olfactory metamers that do not overlap in terms of their volatile composition. One other intriguing issue concerns whether volatiles only come to be associated with taste qualities as a result of associative learning or whether there are some odours that are, for example, naturally (or innately) sweet.},

It was demonstrated that citric acid suppresses the sweetness of sucrose and that, inversely, sucrose suppresses the sourness of citric acid. However, this suppressive effect was not symmetrical in the range of concentrations used. While the degree of sweetness suppression depended only on the citric acid level, the degree of sourness suppression depended on the sucrose as well as on the citric acid concentration. With regard to the perceived total taste intensity of citric acid/sucrose mixtures, it was shown that the sum of sweetness and sourness approximately equals the total taste intensity.

Ultra performance liquid chromatography ({UPLC})−time of ﬂight ({TOF})-mass spectrometry ({ESI}−) proﬁling followed by statistical data analysis revealed a marker substance for a coﬀee beverage spiked with acetaldehyde with an accurate mass of 217.0703 [M − H]−.

Consequently, the acetalization of aldehydes, {QA}, 5-O-caﬀeoyl quinic acid ({CQA}), and quinic acid γ-lactone ({QAL}) was investigated by means of model reactions, followed by synthesis, isolation, and structure elucidation via {UPLC}−{TOF}-{MS} and 1D and 2D {NMR} techniques. {UHPLC}−{MS}/{MSMRM} screening and the quantiﬁcation of aldehyde adducts in coﬀee beverages revealed the presence of {QA}/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, and -/methional reaction products and {CQA}/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, -/2- and 3-methylbutanal, and -/methional and {QAL}/acetaldehyde adducts for the ﬁrst time, in concentrations of 12−270 μg/L for {QA}/aldehydes, 5−225 μg/L for {CQA}/ aldehydes, and 62−173 μg/L for {QAL}/acetaldehyde. The sensory characterization of the identiﬁed compounds showed bitter taste recognition thresholds of 48−297 μmol/L for {CQA} adducts and 658 μmol/L for {QAL}/acetaldehyde, while the {QA} adducts showed no bitter taste ({\textless}2000 μmol/L).},

Here, an analysis of nine different extraction methods is presented regarding analytical and sensory aspects for four espressi and five lunghi. This comprised espresso and lungo from a semi-automatic coffee machine, espresso and lungo from a fully automatic coffee machine, espresso from a single-serve capsule system, mocha made with a percolator, lungo prepared with French Press extraction, filter coffee and lungo extracted with a Bayreuth coffee machine. Analytical measurements included headspace analysis with {HS} {SPME} {GC}/{MS}, acidity ({pH}), titratable acidity, content of fatty acids, total solids, refractive indices (expressed in °Brix), caffeine and chlorogenic acids content with {HPLC}. Sensory analysis included visual, aroma, flavor and textural attributes as well as aftersensation. The technical differences in the extraction methods led to a higher concentration of the respective quantities in the espressi than in the lunghi. Regarding the contents per cup of coffee, the lunghi generally had a higher content than the espressi. The extraction efficiency of the respective compounds was mainly driven by their solubility in water. A higher amount of water, as in the extraction of a lungo, generally led to higher extraction efficiency. Comparing analytical data with sensory profiles, the following positive correlations were found total solids ↔ texture/body, headspace intensity ↔ aroma intensity, concentrations of caffeine/chlorogenic acids ↔ bitterness and astringency.},

	abstract = {Given widespread concerns about sugar intake and health, manufacturers are reformulating their products to help address consumer demand. One common strategy is the use of non-nutritive sweeteners; however, these may come with undesirable bitter and/or metallic side tastes or temporal proﬁles. One alternative sugar reduction strategy involves leveraging perceptual interactions between taste and smell. Prior work suggests that congruent aromas (appropriate for combination with sugar) can enhance sweetness when added to certain foods. However, demonstrating such enhancement psychophysically is not straight forward, as the conceptual strategy used by assessors can inﬂuence whether or not enhancement is observed. Here, a non-scaling approach was used to test for such enhancement. Two simple extensions of the {ABX} test (namely, matching in {ABCX} and {ABCDX} tasks) were used to demonstrate the eﬀect of a congruent (vanilla) and incongruent (beef) aroma on sweetness perception in sweetened milk. Our data suggest both ﬂavors were able to cause enhancement in the ﬂavored milk samples, but enhancement eﬀect was greater for the congruent aroma when compared to the incongruent aroma (p {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, greater enhancement was found via the modiﬁed {ABX} matching test, as compared to data obtained via a scaling task.},

	abstract = {Regarding cross-modality research, taste-aroma interaction is one of the most studied areas of research. Some studies have reported enhancement of sweetness by aroma, although it is unclear as to whether these effects actually occur: depending on the cognitive strategy employed by panelists, the effects may disappear, e.g., forcing panelists into an analytical strategy to control for dumping may not be able to reveal perceptual interactions. Previous studies have largely focused on solutions and model foods, and did not test stimuli or concentrations relevant to real food applications. This study addresses these gaps: 18 vanilla ﬂavored sucrose milks, varying between 0–0.75\% (w/w) two-fold vanilla, and 0–5\% (w/w) sucrose, were rated by 108 panelists for liking and perceived sweetness, vanilla ﬂavor, milk ﬂavor, and thickness. Interactions between vanilla and sucrose were measured using deviations of real mixtures from additive models (via the isobole method), indicating vanilla aroma does enhance perceived sweetness. However, the sweetness enhancing effect of vanilla aroma was not as pronounced as that of sucrose on vanilla ﬂavor. Measurable cross-modal interactions occur despite using an analytical cognitive strategy. More work is needed to investigate the inﬂuence of perceptual strategy on the degree of taste-aroma interactions in real foods.},

	abstract = {The high availability of products with high sugar content, particularly among those targeted as children, has been identiﬁed as one of the factors that contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic. For this reason, product reformulation has been recommended as one of the strategies that can be implemented to achieve short-term reductions in children’s sugar intake. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using cross-modal (taste-odor-texture) interactions as a strategy for reducing the sugar content of products targeted at children, using milk desserts as case study. A series of 5 vanilla milk desserts were formulated: a control sample with 12\% added sugar and 4 sugar-reduced samples (7\% added sugar) prepared following a 2 × 2 experimental design by varying vanilla (0.4\% and 0.6\% w/w) and starch (4.3\% and 4.7\% w/w) concentrations. A total of 112 children (8–12 years old) tasted the desserts and performed a dynamic sensory characterization task using either temporal check-all-that-apply or temporal dominance of sensations. In addition, they assessed the overall liking of all samples. Results showed that sugar-reduced samples did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the control sample in terms of their average overall liking scores. However, individual diﬀerences in children’s hedonic reaction were found; three clusters of children with distinctive liking patterns were identiﬁed. The increase in vanilla and starch concentration led to an increase in overall liking for over 80\% of the children. Sensory dynamic proﬁles revealed signiﬁcant but subtle diﬀerences among samples. Results from the present work suggest that cross-modal interactions could contribute to minimizing the sensory changes caused by sugar reduction, which could enable to achieve larger reductions if implemented in the context of gradual sugar reduction programs.},

	abstract = {Background: Human perception of bitter substances is partially genetically determined. Previously we discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) within the cluster of bitter taste receptor genes on chromosome 12 that accounts for 5.8\% of the variance in the perceived intensity rating of quinine, and we strengthened the classic association between {TAS}2R38 genotype and the bitterness of propylthiouracil ({PROP}). Here we performed a genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) using a 40\% larger sample (n = 1999) together with a bivariate approach to detect previously unidentified common variants with small effects on bitter perception.
Results: We identified two signals, both with small effects ({\textless} 2\%), within the bitter taste receptor clusters on chromosomes 7 and 12, which influence the perceived bitterness of denatonium benzoate and sucrose octaacetate respectively. We also provided the first independent replication for an association of caffeine bitterness on chromosome 12. Furthermore, we provided evidence for pleiotropic effects on quinine, caffeine, sucrose octaacetate and denatonium benzoate for the three {SNPs} on chromosome 12 and the functional importance of the {SNPs} for denatonium benzoate bitterness.
Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of bitter taste and offer a useful starting point for determining the biological pathways linking perception of bitter substances.},

The reduction in average meat intake may be reached via many possible ways, one possibility being the increased consumption of plant-based meat alternatives ({PBMAs}). For this reason, in recent years, hundreds of products have been launched on the market with sensory attributes (i.e., taste, texture, appearance, and smell) similar to their animal counterparts; however, these products have often a long list of ingredients and their nutritional values are very different from animal meat. The present review aims to highlight the main opportunities and challenges related to the production and consumption of {PBMAs} through an interdisciplinary approach. Aspects related to the production technology, nutritional proﬁles, potential impacts on health and the environment, and the current market and consumer acceptance of {PBMAs} are discussed. Focusing on the growing literature on this topic, this review will also highlight research gaps related to {PBMAs} that should be considered in the future, possibly through the collaboration of different stakeholders that can support the transition toward sustainable plantbased diets.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of wet fermentation on flavor volatiles and sensory quality of coffee beans and beverage. Pulped coffee beans were kept underwater for 36 h before air-drying and roasting, and volatiles in the beans were characterized by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. A total of 79 volatiles were identified. Fermented roasted beans had higher concentrations of ethanol, isoamyl alcohol, 3-methylbutanal, benzaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ethyl acetate compared with mechanically processed (no fermentation) beans; whereas, ketones, pyrazines, pyrroles, pyridines, furans and sulfides were not significantly different between the two treatments. Coffee made with fermented beans was rated significantly higher in flavor, aroma, acidity, body and uniformity scores with noted fruity aroma compared with beverage made with mechanically processed beans in sensory evaluation (cup test) by a 3 Q-Grade Coffee Certification Panel. The findings demonstrated wet fermentation played an important role in coffee flavor, aroma and sensory quality.},

	title = {Odor–Taste Interactions in Food Perception: Exposure Protocol Shows No Effects of Associative Learning},
	abstract = {Repeated exposure can change the perceptual and hedonic features of flavor. Associative learning during which a flavor’s odor component is affected by co-exposure with taste is thought to be central in this process. However, changes can also arise due to exposure to the odor in itself. The aim of this study was to dissociate effects of associative learning from effects of exposure without taste by repeatedly presenting one odor together with sucrose and a second odor alone. Sixty individuals attended two testing sessions separated by a 5-day Exposure Phase during which the stimuli were presented as flavorants in chewing gums that were chewed three times daily. Ratings of odor sweetness, odor pleasantness, odor intensity enhancement by taste, and odor referral to the mouth were collected at both sessions. Consistent with the notion that food preferences are modulated by exposure, odor pleasantness increased between the sessions independently of whether the odor (basil or orange flower) had been presented with or without sucrose. However, we found no evidence of associative learning in any of the tasks. In addition, exploratory equivalence tests suggested that these effects were either absent or insignificant in magnitude. Taken together, our results suggest that the hypothesized effects of associative learning are either smaller than previously thought or highly dependent on the experimental setting. Future studies are needed to evaluate the relative support for these explanations and, if experimental conditions can be identified that reliably produce such effects, to identify factors that regulate the formation of new odor–taste associations.},

	abstract = {The combined influence of {TAS}2R38 genotype and {PROP} phenotype on oral sensations is still to be clarified. The present work investigates their influence on the intensity of basic tastes and somatosensory stimuli (capsaicin, aluminium sulphate), using a large cohort of 1117 individuals. The possible influences of gustin genotype and fungiform papillae density were also assessed. {PROP} phenotype was mainly associated with {TAS}2R38 genotype with {AVI}/{AVI} individuals reporting the lowest mean bitterness intensity (12.6 ± 1.26), and {PAV}/{AVI} individuals rating {PROP} lower (46.53 ± 0.93) than {PAV}/{PAV} individuals (54.14 ± 1.33). However, 25\% of {AVI}/{AVI} subjects reported {PROP} bitterness perception higher than ‘moderate’ and small percentages of both {PAV}/{PAV} and {PAV}/ {AVI} responded very little to {PROP} stimulation. {PROP} phenotype significantly affected ratings to all the tastant solutions with {ST} subjects giving the highest ratings and {NT} the lowest. An unexpected systematic effect of {TAS}2R38 diplotype on perceived intensity was found, with {AVI}/{AVI} individuals rating tastant solution intensity higher than {PAV}/{AVI} and {PAV}/{PAV} for all the stimuli. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to determine the influence of the explanatory variables ({TAS}2R38 diplotype, {PROP} status, age and gender) on intensity for each tastant solution. Regression trees indicated that {TAS}2R38 genotype is the most important variable for explaining differences in intensity of basic tastes and astringency, when compared to {PROP} responsiveness, gender, and age. Gender was the primary determinant of heightened perception of pungency. {PROP} status was the second most influential variable in all the models, with limited influence only on sweetness and umami perception. No significant variations of intensity of taste and somatosensory sensations were found in association to gustin polymorphism or fungiform papillae density. These findings call for a re-examination of the notion that the {TAS}2R38 gene uniquely controls {PROP} tasting and for future research devoted to a more in-depth genetic characterization of the {AVI}/{AVI} group and its possible associations with other polymorphisms.},

	abstract = {Perceived intensities of sweetness and bitterness are correlated with one another and each is influenced by genetics. The extent to which these correlations share common genetic variation, however, remains unclear. In a mainly adolescent sample (n = 1901, mean age 16.2 years), including 243 monozygotic ({MZ}) and 452 dizygotic ({DZ}) twin pairs, we estimated the covariance among the perceived intensities of 4 bitter compounds (6-n-propylthiouracil [{PROP}], sucrose octaacetate, quinine, caffeine) and 4 sweeteners (the weighted mean ratings of glucose, fructose, neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, aspartame) with multivariate genetic modeling. The sweetness factor was moderately correlated with sucrose octa-acetate, quinine, and caffeine (rp = 0.35–0.40). This was mainly due to a shared genetic factor (rg = 0.46–0.51) that accounted for 17–37\% of the variance in the 3 bitter compounds’ ratings and 8\% of the variance in general sweetness ratings. In contrast, an association between sweetness and {PROP} only became evident after adjusting for the {TAS}2R38 diplotype (rp increased from 0.18 to 0.32) with the {PROP} genetic factor accounting for 6\% of variance in sweetness. These genetic associations were not inflated by scale use bias, as the crosstrait correlations for both {MZ} and {DZ} twins were weak. There was also little evidence for mediation by cognition or behavioral factors.This suggests an overlap of genetic variance between perceptions of sweetness and bitterness from a variety of stimuli, which includes {PROP} when considering the {TAS}2R38 diplotype. The most likely sources of shared variation are within genes encoding postreceptor transduction mechanisms common to the various taste G protein-coupled receptors.},

	shorttitle = {Acids in brewed coffees},
	abstract = {Coffee brewed on light, and very light-roast coffee beans have emerged as a recent trend among specialty coffee drinkers. The acidity of such light-roast coffee, and coffee in general, is an important sensory characteristic, as there is demonstrated a clear correlation between the roast level and perceived acidity in brewed coffee. The acidity is believed to be strongly linked to the content and composition of organic acids in coffee. Still, there is limited literature on acid content in brewed coffee and on the relevance of specific acid concentrations to sensory perception. In this study, we determined concentrations of acids and sugars in French-press brewed specialty coffee. We used varying roast degrees in the light to very light range using five coffees from different geographical locations (Brazil, Bolivia, and Kenya) and determined the sensory detection threshold and recognition for selected acids. The concentration of all individual acids except one (formic) either significantly decreased (citric, malic, and chlorogenic acid) or increased (acetic, lactic, phosphoric, quinic, and glycolic acid) systematically with an increasing roast degree, while no systematic trends were found between the different coffee samples. The sugar content decreased with an increasing roast degree. The sensory detection threshold for malic, acetic, and lactic acid was determined to be above the actual concentration of said acids in the coffee and just below for phosphoric acid, indicating that these compounds are unlikely to individually be perceived in coffee. Only citric acid can be clearly detected in the threshold test (not identified by experts in coffee) in concentrations above the measured concentrations, as the detection threshold was below ({\textless}0.16 g/L) the concentration found in the investigated coffees (0.23–0.60 g/L). The measured citric acid concentration was found to be much higher for the Brazil coffees (0.49 ± 0.08 g/L) compared to the Bolivia coffee (0.40 ± 0.11 g/L), and the Kenya coffees (0.30 ± 0.07 g/L). Furthermore, none of the acids added to the coffee were correctly recognized by coffee experts when spiked with measured average concentrations. Combined, the results question the direct relation between individual organic acids and acidity in coffee and point towards a more complex understanding of perceived acidity.},
