Background: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world and is commonly consumed with milk to reduce bitterness and sourness(1). 
However, it is unknown how milk reduces these attributes when added to coffee. 
Previous studies(2) have made comparisons between black coffee and whitened (milk-added) coffee. 
However, milk is ~86% water(3), so the coffee samples could be reduced in bitterness and sourness just by diluting the coffee. 
This study aims to investigate whether adding milk to coffee reduces the perceived bitterness and sourness more than adding the same volume of water. 
Additionally, this study assess the impact of olfaction on the perception of bitterness and sourness in whitened coffee beverages.

Method: Two experiments were conducted. 
In the first experiment, 29 coffee drinkers used nose clips to assess the perceived bitterness and sourness of cold-brew coffee with commercial skim milk (SK), commercial whole milk (WH) or water (H2O) was added at 8% (v/v) or 17% (v/v). 
In the second experiment, 34 coffee drinkers assessed perceived bitterness and sourness without a nose clip. 
Participants in all studies performed 2-AFC tests with one sample having water and the other sample having milk added. 
Participants also indicated their confidence and gave intensity ratings to both samples. 

Results: 
1:10 Bitter
NC - 8% Wh/H R = 0.63 (Rcriti = 0.62), NSD Ratings (dx = 0.155)
NO  - 17% Wh/H R = 0.74, Ratings (p < 0.001, dx = 1.14)

1:10 Sour
NC - all but 8% WH/H R > 0.79, ratings p < 0.001, dx > 1.38
  - 8% WH/H R = 0.79 (p < 0.001), ratings NSD (p = 0.03, dx = 0.74)
NO - all R > 0.75, ratings < 0.001, dx > 0.41
  - 17% SK/H dx = 0.41
  - others dx > 0.70

For bitterness, in the nose closed condition, only the 8% WH/H comparison was significant in R index (R = 0.63, p = 0.05), but not in the intensity ratings (p = 0.94, mean difference = -0.67). 
All comparisons had a significant R index when assessing sourness (R > 0.74, p < 0.001). 
All comparisons had significant differences in sourness ratings (p < 0.001, mean difference > 1.38) except the 8% WH/H, which was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons (p = 0.03, mean difference = 0.74).
In the nose open condition, the 17% water sample was perceived as significantly more bitter than 17% whole milk in both the R-index (R = 0.74, p < 0.001) and intensity ratings (p < 0.001. mean difference = 1.14).
All comparisons assessing sourness were significant in both the R index (R > 0.75, p < 0.001) and sourness intensity ratings (p < 0.05, mean difference > 0.41).

Discussion:
Results indicate that adding 8% SK or WH was not enough to influence bitterness perception, regardless of olfaction. 
8% SK or WH was able to significantly reduce perceived sourness in all nose-closed comparisons. 
This was also reflected in the sourness intensity ratings, where all but the 1:10 8% WH/H ratings were significantly different (p < 0.05).  

Implications:
The presence of olfaction is needed to observe the bitterness reducing effect that milk can have on CB coffee. 
This study saw significant decreases in bitterness only when whole milk was added to the cold brew. 
Future research should continue to investigate the nature of cross-modal interactions on bitterness between coffee and milk.
