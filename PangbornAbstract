Background: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world and is commonly consumed with milk to reduce bitterness and sourness(1). 
However, it is unknown how milk reduces these attributes when added to coffee. 
Previous studies(2) have made comparisons between black coffee and whitened (milk-added) coffee. 
However, milk is ~86% water(3), so the coffee samples could be reduced in bitterness and sourness just by diluting the coffee. 
This study aims to investigate whether adding milk to coffee reduces the perceived bitterness and sourness more than adding the same volume of water. 
Additionally, this study assess the impact of olfaction on the perception of bitterness and sourness in whitened coffee beverages.

Method: Four experiments were conducted. 
In the first experiment, 29 coffee drinkers used nose clips to assess the perceived bitterness and sourness of cold-brew coffee with commercial skim milk (SK), commercial whole milk (WH) or water (H2O) was added at 8% (v/v) or 17% (v/v). 
In the second experiment, 34 coffee drinkers assessed perceived bitterness and sourness without a nose clip. 
In the third experiment, 32 coffee drinkers used nose clips to assess the perceived bitterness and sourness of a cold brew concentrate with SK, WH, or H2O added. 
In the fourth experiment, 34 coffee drinkers assessed perceived bitterness and sourness of whitened cold brew concentrate without a nose clip. 
Participants in all studies performed 2-AFC tests with one sample having water and the other sample having milk added. 
Participants also indicated their confidence and gave intensity ratings to both samples. 

Results: 
1:10 Bitter
NC - 8% Wh/H R = 0.63 (Rcriti = 0.62), NSD Ratings (dx = 0.155)
NO  - 17% Wh/H R = 0.74, Ratings (p < 0.001, dx = 1.14)

1:10 Sour
NC - all but 8% WH/H R > 0.79, ratings p < 0.001, dx > 1.38
  - 8% WH/H R = 0.79 (p < 0.001), ratings NSD (p = 0.03, dx = 0.74)
NO - all R > 0.75, ratings < 0.001, dx > 0.41
  - 17% SK/H dx = 0.41
  - others dx > 0.70

1:5 Bitter
NC - NSD in R index or ratings
NO - 17% WH/H R = 0.74, ratings p = 0.013, dx = 0.906

1:5 Sour
NC - 8% WH/H R = 0.58, ratings p = 0.08, dx = 0.507
  - others R index > 0.75, ratings p < 0.001, dx > 0.82
NO - 8% SK/H R = 0.63, p <=  0.05, rating NSD, p = 0.067, dx = 0.474
  - others R index > 0.708, p < 0.001, ratings p < 0.002, dx > 0.83


Discussion:
Results indicate that adding 8% SK or WH was not enough to influence bitterness perception, regardless of olfaction or brew strength. 
8% SK or WH was able to significantly reduce perceived sourness in all nose-closed comparisons except 8% WH/H (R = 0.58) with the concentrated coffee. 
This was also reflected in the sourness intensity ratings, where all but the 1:10 8% WH/H ratings were significantly different (p < 0.05).  

Implications:
The presence of olfaction is needed to observe the bitterness reducing effect that milk can have on CB coffee. 
This study saw significant decreases in bitterness only when whole milk was added to the cold brew. 
Future research should continue to investigate the nature of cross-modal interactions on bitterness between coffee and milk.
