# 1:10 Bitterness {#Bitter10}

This will be the data analysis and results of the 1:10 nose closed study run in December 2024 and the 1:10 nose open study run in September 2023.  

A 1:10 brew strength (coffee:water, w/w) is representative of a strong ratio used by everyday consumers. Our hypotheses was:  

> Milk will reduce the bitterness of cold brew coffee more than water  

This hypothesis is thought to be seen regardless of condition (nose closed or nose open). 

Some interpretations of expected data would be:

- In the nose closed condition a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee  
- Milk, being 86% water [@walstraDairyTechnologyPrinciples1999] could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee   
- In the nose opened condition, a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) 

> Inclusion criteria included drinking coffee at least once a month.

### R Index  
In the paired comparisons between when skim milk or whole milk was added to the coffee, there is not enough evidence to suggest one will reduce the bitterness more than the other [cf. @keastModificationBitternessCaffeine2008].  

The critical value for a 2-tailed test is **`r round(Rcriti(length(df10closed$participant), length(df10closed$participant), 0.05, 1)[2],2)`**.  
```{r study1closed rindex milks, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

- Interestingly, only comparisons at the 8% addition level reached significance
    + the skim milk sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the whole milk sample (Figure \@ref(fig:study1ClosedMilkRViz))  
    + the water sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the whole milk sample (Figure \@ref(fig:study1ClosedWaterRViz), red bar)
    
- This is somewhat counter intuitive to what we had hypothesized, as adding more milk (the 17% samples) should have also shown discrimination  
    + what are alternative interpretations/explanations?
      + *01092025*: could fat be creating an inhibitive coating on the tongue where bitter compounds can't connect to the receptors?
      +*01142025*: the skim milk being perceived as more bitter could be a type I error, a false positive

### Ratings  
The paired comparison will only show which sample is more bitter (or discriminated against), without showing a magnitude of the difference. Thus, bitterness intensity ratings were recorded as well. They will be analyzed by paired t-test with a Bonferroni correction against multiple comparisons.  

```{r study1closed ratings wrangling, include=FALSE}

  pivot_longer(-participant, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "Intensity")

sample_order10B <- c("bitterness_13", "bitterness_15", "bitterness_14", "bitterness_17", "bitterness_16", "bitterness_18", "bitterness_19", "bitterness_21", "bitterness_20", "bitterness_23", "bitterness_22", "bitterness_24")

# use $statistic to print t-value

- Figure \@ref(fig:study1MilkCombineRViz), where the 8% skim milk sample was discriminated against the 8% whole milk sample in the nose closed condition only presents an interesting piece to this puzzle.  
    + @keastModificationBitternessCaffeine2008 suggested that skim milk would reduce the bitterness of caffeine more than whole milk  
    + @bennettUsingMilkFat2012 found that whole milk reduced the bitterness of ibuprofen marginally compared to skim milk (p = 0.1), but not compared to half-and-half

- Figure \@ref(fig:study1WaterCombineRViz) continues to present interesting data in the nose closed condition when testing the 8% Addition comparisons (cf. Figure \@ref(fig:study1MilkCombineRViz))  
    + the skim milk sample was chosen as the more bitter sample compared to the same amount (8%) of water (white bar)  
    + the whole milk sample was chosen as the less bitter sample compared to water (red bar)  
- Neither of these effects are seen in the nose opened condition
    + this data does not look at the possibility of removing panelists in the nose closed condition that responded that they were not regular coffee drinkers in the demographic questions. It may be of interest to see how/if the data changes when removing them (or segmenting them).
