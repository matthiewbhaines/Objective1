# 1:10 Sourness {#Sour10}

This will be the data analysis and results of the 1:10 nose closed study run in December 2024 and the 1:10 nose open study run in September 2023 on sourness.  
You can refer to the 1:10 Bitterness results [here](#Bitter10).  

A 1:10 brew strength (coffee:water, w/w) is representative of a strong ratio used by everyday consumers. Our hypotheses was:  

> Milk will reduce the sourness of cold brew coffee more than water  

This hypothesis is thought to be seen regardless of condition (nose closed or nose open). 

Some interpretations of expected data would be:

- In the nose closed condition a reduction in sourness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee  
- Milk, being 86% water [@walstraDairyTechnologyPrinciples1999] could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee   
- In the nose opened condition, a reduction in sourness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) 

## Nose Closed Condition







### R Index  
 
The critical value for a 2-tailed test is **0.62**.  




- no discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% whole milk was added to coffee (R Index = 0.56, p > 0.05)  



- no discrimination between 17% skim milk or 17% whole milk added to coffee, (R Index = 0.51, p > 0.05)

For the paired comparisons between milk and water, we hypothesized that the addition of milk would reduce the sourness, therefore making the water sample the more sour. The critical value for a one tailed R-index calculation is **0.62**.  





- discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.86, p $\le$ **0.001**)  

- discrimination seen between when 8% whole milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.75, p $\le$ **0.001**)   



- discrimination between the 17% skim milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.81, p $\le$ **0.001**)  
- discrimination between the 17% whole milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.86, p $\le$ **0.001**)

</div>

- no discrimination seen between the sourness of skim milk or whole milk at either level (p > 0.05, see Figure \@ref(fig:study2ClosedWaterRViz))  
- milk, even at the 8% addition level, was able to be discriminated against the same amount of water added to the cold brew coffee (see Figure \@ref(fig:study2ClosedWaterRViz))

### Ratings  
The paired comparison will only show which sample is more sour (or discriminated against), without showing a magnitude of the difference. Thus, sourness intensity ratings were recorded as well. They will be analyzed by paired t-test with a Bonferroni correction against multiple comparisons.

- Figure \@ref(fig:study2WaterCombineRViz) continues to present interesting data in the nose closed condition when testing the 8% Addition comparisons (cf. Figure \@ref(fig:study2MilkCombineRViz))  
    + the skim milk sample was chosen as the more sour sample compared to the same amount (8%) of water (white bar)  
    + the whole milk sample was chosen as the less sour sample compared to water (red bar)  
- Neither of these effects are seen in the nose opened condition
    + this data does not look at the possibility of removing panelists in the nose closed condition that responded that they were not regular coffee drinkers in the demographic questions. It may be of interest to see how/if the data changes when removing them (or segmenting them).  

## Notes {-}
<input type="checkbox"> examine the participant data  
  - do panelists need to be excluded because they do not meet inclusion criteria?  
<input type="checkbox"> update Rindex figures like Chris described  
<input type="checkbox"> resolve `warnings()`?
