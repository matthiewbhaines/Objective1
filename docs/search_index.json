You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

A 1:10 brew strength (coffee:water, w/w) is representative of a strong ratio used by everyday consumers. Our hypotheses was: Milk will reduce the bitterness of cold brew coffee more than water This hypothesis is thought to be seen regardless of condition (nose closed or nose open). Some interpretations of expected data would be: In the nose closed condition a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee Milk, being 86% water (Walstra et al. 1999) could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee In the nose opened condition, a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) 2.1 Nose Closed Condition 2.1.1 R Index In the paired comparisons between when skim milk or whole milk was added to the coffee, there is not enough evidence to suggest one will reduce the bitterness more than the other (cf. Keast 2008). The critical value for a 2-tailed test is 0.62. discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% whole milk was added to coffee (R Index = 0.66, p \\(\\leq\\) 0.05) interestingly, the skim milk sample (the “noise”) was chosen more frequently than the whole milk sample (the “signal”): 20/30 no discrimination between 17% skim milk or 17% whole milk added to coffee (R Index = 0.58, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 2.1: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and whole milk at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the water sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). For the paired comparisons between milk and water, we hypothesized that the addition of milk would reduce the bitterness, therefore making the water sample the more bitter sample. The critical value for a one tailed R-index calculation is 0.62. discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.63, 0.05 \\(\\ge\\) p \\(\\ge\\) 0.01) interestingly, the skim milk sample (the “noise”) was chosen more frequently than the water sample (the “signal”): 19/30 discrimination seen between when 8% whole milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.65, 0.05 \\(\\ge\\) p \\(\\ge\\) 0.01) no discrimination between the 17% skim milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.52, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between the 17% whole milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.53, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 2.2: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and water at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the water sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, only comparisons at the 8% addition level reached significance the skim milk sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the whole milk sample (Figure 2.1) the skim milk sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the water sample (Figure 2.2, white bar) the water sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the whole milk sample (Figure 2.2, red bar) This is somewhat counter intuitive to what we had hypothesized, as adding more milk (the 17% samples) should have also shown discrimination what are alternative interpretations/explanations? 01092025: could fat be creating an inhibitive coating on the tongue where bitter compounds can’t connect to the receptors? 2.1.2 Ratings The paired comparison will only show which sample is more bitter (or discriminated against), without showing a magnitude of the difference. Thus, bitterness intensity ratings were recorded as well. They will be analyzed by paired t-test with a Bonferroni correction against multiple comparisons.

Figure 2.9, where the 8% skim milk sample was discriminated against the 8% whole milk sample in the nose closed condition only presents an interesting piece to this puzzle. Keast (2008) suggested that skim milk would reduce the bitterness of caffeine more than whole milk Bennett, Zhou, and Hayes (2012) found that whole milk reduced the bitterness of ibuprofen marginally compared to skim milk (p = 0.1), but not compared to half-and-half Figure 2.10: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk, whole milk, and water at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed and nose opened condition. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the water sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). Figure 2.10 continues to present interesting data in the nose closed condition when testing the 8% Addition comparisons (cf. Figure 2.9) the skim milk sample was chosen as the more bitter sample compared to the same amount (8%) of water (white bar) the whole milk sample was chosen as the less bitter sample compared to water (red bar) Neither of these effects are seen in the nose opened condition this data does not look at the possibility of removing panelists in the nose closed condition that responded that they were not regular coffee drinkers in the demographic questions. It may be of interest to see how/if the data changes when removing them (or segmenting them). Notes examine the participant data - do panelists need to be excluded because they do not meet inclusion criteria? update Rindex figures like Chris described resolve warnings()?

It may be of interest to see how/if the data changes when removing them (or segmenting them). Notes examine the participant data - do panelists need to be excluded because they do not meet inclusion criteria? update Rindex figures like Chris described resolve warnings()?

See the 1:10 brew strength bitter analysis here. A 1:5 brew strength (coffee:water, w/w) is representative of a cold brew concentrate. Our hypotheses (note 12-24-24: the following were not hypotheses, they are interpretations) were as follows: In the nose closed condition a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee Milk, being 86% water (Walstra et al. 1999) could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee In the nose opened condition, a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) Note 12-24-24: We had initially hypothesized that there would be a physicochemical interaction (such as protein-polyphenol interaction) Note 01-06-25: I think the hypothesis was that the addition of milk would reduce the bitterness of cold brew coffee. 4.1 Nose Closed Condition 4.1.1 R Index In the paired comparisons between when skim milk or whole milk was added to the coffee, there is not enough evidence to suggest one will reduce the bitterness more than the other (cf.
