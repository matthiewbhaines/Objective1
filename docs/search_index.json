A 1:10 brew strength (coffee:water, w/w) is representative of a strong ratio used by everyday consumers. Our hypotheses was: Milk will reduce the bitterness of cold brew coffee more than water This hypothesis is thought to be seen regardless of condition (nose closed or nose open). Some interpretations of expected data would be: In the nose closed condition a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee Milk, being 86% water (Walstra et al. 1999) could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee In the nose opened condition, a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) Inclusion criteria included drinking coffee at least once a month. 2.1 Nose Closed Condition 2.1.1 Participant Data Study1Meta &lt;- read_xlsx(path = &quot;Objective1CompiledDataWithIndex.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 4) %&gt;% clean_names() colnames(Study1Meta) ## [1] &quot;panelist_code&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ## [4] &quot;indian_alaskan&quot; &quot;asian_indian_islander&quot; &quot;black&quot; ## [7] &quot;white&quot; &quot;hispanic_latino&quot; &quot;other&quot; ## [10] &quot;consumption&quot; &quot;sweetener&quot; &quot;whitener&quot; ## [13] &quot;how_white&quot; Study1Meta %&gt;% filter(consumption == &quot;6&quot;) #osu27 ## # A tibble: 1 × 13 ## panelist_code age gender indian_alaskan asian_indian_islander black white ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 osu27 29 2 0 1 0 0 ## # ℹ 6 more variables: hispanic_latino &lt;dbl&gt;, other &lt;dbl&gt;, consumption &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # sweetener &lt;dbl&gt;, whitener &lt;dbl&gt;, how_white &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo Study1MetaInc &lt;- Study1Meta %&gt;% filter(panelist_code != &quot;osu27&quot;) describe(Study1MetaInc)[2,] %&gt;% select(mean, sd, median, min, max) #age ## mean sd median min max ## age 30.14 12.1 26 22 86 Study1MetaInc %&gt;% count(gender) # 11 males, 18 females ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## gender n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 11 ## 2 2 18 Study1MetaInc %&gt;% group_by(sweetener, whitener) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% spread(whitener, n) %&gt;% replace(is.na(.), 0) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## # Groups: sweetener [2] ## sweetener `1` `2` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 14 0 ## 2 2 10 5 # 11 - whiten and sweeten # 12 - whiten, no sweeten # 21 - sweeten, no whiten # 22 - black coffee drinker Study1MetaInc %&gt;% count(consumption) ## # A tibble: 5 × 2 ## consumption n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 18 ## 2 2 5 ## 3 3 2 ## 4 4 3 ## 5 5 1 # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo one participant (F) drank coffee less frequently than once a month. therefore they will be removed 2.1.2 R Index In the paired comparisons between when skim milk or whole milk was added to the coffee, there is not enough evidence to suggest one will reduce the bitterness more than the other (cf. Keast 2008). 02032025: I guess, according to Keast (2008), the whole milk would be the signal, as it would be expected to be more bitter than the skim milk (again, based solely on this paper). The critical value for a 2-tailed test is 0.62. discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% whole milk was added to coffee (R Index = 0.35, p \\(\\leq\\) 0.05) interestingly, the skim milk sample (the “noise”) was chosen more frequently than the whole milk sample (the “signal”): 19/29 no discrimination between 17% skim milk or 17% whole milk added to coffee (R Index (*_S*) = 0.57, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 2.1: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and whole milk at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition. The Skim Milk R-index is positioned above the thick horizontal line; the Whole Milk R-index is positioned below. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the skim milk sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the whole milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). All significance at alpha = 0.10 is noted. For the paired comparisons between milk and water, we hypothesized that the addition of milk would reduce the bitterness, therefore making the water sample the more bitter sample. The critical value for a one tailed R-index calculation is 0.62. marginal discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.61, p &lt; 0.10) interestingly, the skim milk sample (the “noise”) was chosen more frequently than the water sample (the “signal”): 18/29 discrimination seen between when 8% whole milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.63, p \\(\\le\\) 0.05) no discrimination between the 17% skim milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.5, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between the 17% whole milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.44, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 2.2: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk, whole milk, and water at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition. The Milk R-indices are positioned above the thick horizontal line; the water R-index is positioned below. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the water sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). All significance at alpha = 0.10 is noted. Interestingly, only comparisons at the 8% addition level reached significance the skim milk sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the whole milk sample (Figure 2.1) the water sample was chosen as more bitter compared to the whole milk sample (Figure 2.2, red bar) This is somewhat counter intuitive to what we had hypothesized, as adding more milk (the 17% samples) should have also shown discrimination what are alternative interpretations/explanations? 01092025: could fat be creating an inhibitive coating on the tongue where bitter compounds can’t connect to the receptors? +01142025: the skim milk being perceived as more bitter could be a type I error, a false positive 02032025: it is counter to a physicochemical-based hypothesis, it is also unintuitive why significance is only seen at an 8% level (marginal with skim milk being more bitter than water (cf. Keast (2008)), the whole milk being less bitter than water) 2.1.3 Ratings The paired comparison will only show which sample is more bitter (or discriminated against), without showing a magnitude of the difference. Thus, bitterness intensity ratings were recorded as well. They will be analyzed by paired t-test with a Bonferroni correction against multiple comparisons.

Some interpretations of expected data would be: In the nose closed condition a reduction in sourness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee Milk, being 86% water (Walstra et al. 1999) could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee In the nose opened condition, a reduction in sourness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) 3.1 Nose Closed Condition 3.1.1 Participant Data Study2Meta &lt;- read_xlsx(path = &quot;Objective1CompiledDataWithIndex.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 4) %&gt;% clean_names() colnames(Study2Meta) ## [1] &quot;panelist_code&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ## [4] &quot;indian_alaskan&quot; &quot;asian_indian_islander&quot; &quot;black&quot; ## [7] &quot;white&quot; &quot;hispanic_latino&quot; &quot;other&quot; ## [10] &quot;consumption&quot; &quot;sweetener&quot; &quot;whitener&quot; ## [13] &quot;how_white&quot; Study2Meta %&gt;% filter(consumption == &quot;6&quot;) #osu27 ## # A tibble: 1 × 13 ## panelist_code age gender indian_alaskan asian_indian_islander black white ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 osu27 29 2 0 1 0 0 ## # ℹ 6 more variables: hispanic_latino &lt;dbl&gt;, other &lt;dbl&gt;, consumption &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # sweetener &lt;dbl&gt;, whitener &lt;dbl&gt;, how_white &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo Study2MetaInc &lt;- Study2Meta %&gt;% filter(panelist_code != &quot;osu27&quot;) describe(Study2MetaInc)[2,] %&gt;% select(mean, sd, median, min, max) #age ## mean sd median min max ## age 30.14 12.1 26 22 86 Study2MetaInc %&gt;% count(gender) # 11 males, 18 females ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## gender n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 11 ## 2 2 18 Study2MetaInc %&gt;% group_by(sweetener, whitener) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% spread(whitener, n) %&gt;% replace(is.na(.), 0) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## # Groups: sweetener [2] ## sweetener `1` `2` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 14 0 ## 2 2 10 5 # 11 - whiten and sweeten # 12 - whiten, no sweeten # 21 - sweeten, no whiten # 22 - black coffee drinker Study2MetaInc %&gt;% count(consumption) ## # A tibble: 5 × 2 ## consumption n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 18 ## 2 2 5 ## 3 3 2 ## 4 4 3 ## 5 5 1 # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo one participant (F) drank coffee less frequently than once a month. therefore they will be removed 3.1.2 R Index The critical value for a 2-tailed test is 0.62. no discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% whole milk was added to coffee (R Index = 0.46, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between 17% skim milk or 17% whole milk added to coffee, (R Index = 0.51, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 3.1: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and whole milk at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition.

Thus, sourness intensity ratings were recorded as well. They will be analyzed by paired t-test with a Bonferroni correction against multiple comparisons.

Some interpretations of expected data would be: In the nose closed condition a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee Milk, being 86% water (Walstra et al. 1999) could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee In the nose opened condition, a reduction in bitterness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) 4.1 Nose Closed Condition 4.1.1 Participant Data Study3Meta &lt;- read_xlsx(path = &quot;Objective1CompiledDataWithIndex.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 6) %&gt;% clean_names() colnames(Study3Meta) ## [1] &quot;panelist_code&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ## [4] &quot;indian_alaska_native&quot; &quot;asian&quot; &quot;black&quot; ## [7] &quot;white&quot; &quot;latinx&quot; &quot;other&quot; ## [10] &quot;other_comment&quot; &quot;consumption&quot; &quot;sweetener&quot; ## [13] &quot;sweetener_comment&quot; &quot;whitener&quot; &quot;whitener_comment&quot; ## [16] &quot;quantity_whitener&quot; Study3Meta %&gt;% filter(consumption == &quot;6&quot;) #osu24 ## # A tibble: 1 × 16 ## panelist_code age gender indian_alaska_native asian black white latinx other ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 osu24 27 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## # ℹ 7 more variables: other_comment &lt;chr&gt;, consumption &lt;dbl&gt;, sweetener &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # sweetener_comment &lt;chr&gt;, whitener &lt;dbl&gt;, whitener_comment &lt;chr&gt;, ## # quantity_whitener &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo describe(Study3Meta)[2, ] #%&gt;% select(mean, sd, median, min, max) #age ## Study3Meta ## ## 1 Variables 32 Observations ## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## age ## n missing distinct Info Mean pMedian Gmd .05 ## 32 0 13 0.987 27.09 26 5.607 22.00 ## .10 .25 .50 .75 .90 .95 ## 23.00 24.00 25.00 29.00 32.00 34.35 ## ## Value 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 29 31 32 33 ## Frequency 1 2 4 6 4 4 2 2 2 2 1 ## Proportion 0.031 0.062 0.125 0.188 0.125 0.125 0.062 0.062 0.062 0.062 0.031 ## ## Value 36 55 ## Frequency 1 1 ## Proportion 0.031 0.031 ## ## For the frequency table, variable is rounded to the nearest 0 ## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Study3Meta %&gt;% count(gender) # 10 males, 24 females ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## gender n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 9 ## 2 2 23 Study3Meta %&gt;% group_by(sweetener, whitener) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% spread(whitener, n) %&gt;% replace(is.na(.), 0) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## # Groups: sweetener [2] ## sweetener `1` `2` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 21 1 ## 2 2 8 2 # 11 - whiten and sweeten # 12 - whiten, no sweeten # 21 - sweeten, no whiten # 22 - black coffee drinker Study3Meta %&gt;% count(consumption) ## # A tibble: 5 × 2 ## consumption n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 20 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 2 ## 4 4 3 ## 5 6 1 # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo remove one participant (F) because they did not meet inclusion criteria 4.1.2 R Index In the paired comparisons between when skim milk or whole milk was added to the coffee, there is not enough evidence to suggest one will reduce the bitterness more than the other (cf. Keast 2008). The critical value for a 2-tailed test is 0.62. no discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% whole milk was added to coffee (R Index = 0.57, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between 17% skim milk or 17% whole milk added to coffee, (R Index = 0.58, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 4.1: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and whole milk at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the water sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). For the paired comparisons between milk and water, we hypothesized that the addition of milk would reduce the bitterness, therefore making the water sample the more bitter. The critical value for a one tailed R-index calculation is 0.62. no discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.59, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination seen between when 8% whole milk and 8% water was added to coffee (R Index = 0.54, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between the 17% skim milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.53, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between the 17% whole milk and 17% water samples (R Index = 0.57, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 4.2: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and water at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition. Dashed horizontal line represents the critical value, which denotes statistical significance, or discrimination between the samples on bitterness. Grey bars are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Red bars indicate the water sample (‘Signal’) was significant; White bars indicate the milk sample (‘Noise’) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). No discrimination was seen at either the 8% or 17% addition levels To me, this calls into question Figure 2.2 4.1.3 Ratings The paired comparison will only show which sample is more bitter (or discriminated against), without showing a magnitude of the difference. Thus, bitterness intensity ratings were recorded as well. They will be analyzed by paired t-test with a Bonferroni correction against multiple comparisons.

Some interpretations of expected data would be: In the nose closed condition a reduction in sourness from the milky coffee would suggest a physicochemical interaction between the milk and coffee Milk, being 86% water (Walstra et al. 1999) could have a similar effect as water would when added to coffee In the nose opened condition, a reduction in sourness from the milky coffee could suggest a cross-modal interaction (particularly if no effect is seen in the nose closed condition) 5.1 Nose Closed Condition 5.1.1 Participant Data Study4Meta &lt;- read_xlsx(path = &quot;Objective1CompiledDataWithIndex.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 8) %&gt;% clean_names() colnames(Study4Meta) ## [1] &quot;panelist_code&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ## [4] &quot;indian_alaskan&quot; &quot;asian_indian_islander&quot; &quot;black&quot; ## [7] &quot;hispanic_latino&quot; &quot;white&quot; &quot;other&quot; ## [10] &quot;race_comment&quot; &quot;consumption&quot; &quot;sweetener&quot; ## [13] &quot;sweetener_comments&quot; &quot;whitener&quot; &quot;whitener_comments&quot; ## [16] &quot;how_white&quot; Study4Meta %&gt;% filter(consumption == &quot;6&quot;) ## # A tibble: 0 × 16 ## # ℹ 16 variables: panelist_code &lt;chr&gt;, age &lt;dbl&gt;, gender &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # indian_alaskan &lt;dbl&gt;, asian_indian_islander &lt;dbl&gt;, black &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # hispanic_latino &lt;dbl&gt;, white &lt;dbl&gt;, other &lt;dbl&gt;, race_comment &lt;chr&gt;, ## # consumption &lt;dbl&gt;, sweetener &lt;dbl&gt;, sweetener_comments &lt;chr&gt;, ## # whitener &lt;dbl&gt;, whitener_comments &lt;chr&gt;, how_white &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo describe(Study4Meta)[2, ] # %&gt;% select(mean, sd, median, min, max) #age ## Study4Meta ## ## 1 Variables 30 Observations ## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## age ## n missing distinct Info Mean pMedian Gmd .05 ## 30 0 14 0.99 28.83 27 7.772 22.45 ## .10 .25 .50 .75 .90 .95 ## 23.00 24.00 26.00 29.75 33.00 35.20 ## ## Value 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ## Frequency 2 3 4 3 5 2 1 2 2 1 1 ## Proportion 0.067 0.100 0.133 0.100 0.167 0.067 0.033 0.067 0.067 0.033 0.033 ## ## Value 33 37 85 ## Frequency 2 1 1 ## Proportion 0.067 0.033 0.033 ## ## For the frequency table, variable is rounded to the nearest 0 ## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Study4Meta %&gt;% count(gender) # 10 males, 24 females ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## gender n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 9 ## 2 2 21 Study4Meta %&gt;% group_by(sweetener, whitener) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% spread(whitener, n) %&gt;% replace(is.na(.), 0) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## # Groups: sweetener [2] ## sweetener `1` `2` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 16 0 ## 2 2 9 5 # 11 - whiten and sweeten # 12 - whiten, no sweeten # 21 - sweeten, no whiten # 22 - black coffee drinker Study4Meta %&gt;% count(consumption) ## # A tibble: 5 × 2 ## consumption n ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 19 ## 2 2 6 ## 3 3 2 ## 4 4 1 ## 5 5 2 # 1 - daily; 2 - 2-3/wk; 3- 1/wk # 4 - 2-3/mo; 5 - 1/mo; 6 &lt;1/mo 5.1.2 R Index The critical value for a 2-tailed test is 0.62. no discrimination seen between when 8% skim milk and 8% whole milk was added to coffee (R Index = 0.58, p &gt; 0.05) no discrimination between 17% skim milk or 17% whole milk added to coffee, (R Index = 0.5, p &gt; 0.05) Figure 5.1: R Index of paired comparison between skim milk and whole milk at an 8% addition level and 17% addition level in a nose closed condition.
